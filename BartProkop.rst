Real world examples.

I created this page to contribute to this project by step by step describing Open WRT instalations running in real word. I created those instalations mostly to implement advanced router features. My intention is to provide step by step log of commands and settings necessary to achieve certain configuration.

=== Router requested features ===
This is the very first advanced configuration with Open WRT I want to describe. The requirements were as follow:
 1. The embeded device shall provide Internet access to all conected computers with different policy for some groups of users.
 2. The embeded device will replace the existing routing capabilities of Linux server. I do not want to route via Linux server anymore as it has many many other things to do and is under haavy reconfiguration process.
 3. List of features on embeded devices:
  * service MORE than one separate LAN conected to embeded device
  * slave DNS server (to existing Linux server)
  * PPTP server (take this feature from Linux server)
  * QoS
 4.
