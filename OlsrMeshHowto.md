= Introduction =

Mesh networks self-arrange and auto-configure themselves on the basis of
network topology changes. For example, the properly configured OLSR mesh
will automatically arrange itself in cases where one node fails, or when
a new route emerges, or when a low traffic route becomes available or
disappears. The concept of a mesh network is not new; the Internet
itself is a huge mesh network. So what's new? Well, mesh networks with
wireless technology on OpenWrt simply rocks! ;)

OLSR is one of the routing protocols available to create a
\[<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_ad-hoc_network> Mobile Adhoc
Networks (MANET)\], or rather, in more general terms, a wireless mesh
network. \[<http://www.olsr.org> The OLSR code developed by Andreas
Tønnesen\] is the best suited for our case as packages have been created
for OpenWrt.

This wiki page contains information on how to create an OLSR mesh
network by configuring OpenWrt and olsrd (the OLSR daemon process)
yourself. If your objective is to get an OLSR network quickly running,
you may want to have a look at firmware that has been specifically
created for this purpose. An example of this sort of firmare is the
\[<http://firmware.freifunk.net> Freifunk project\]. If you're
determined to get OLSR running on OpenWrt without the assistance of
pre-packaged firmare, keep reading!

= The Network =

There are an infinite number of ways that a mesh network can be
configured; below is a simple example that allows routing over a set of
subnets in the 10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0 range through the OLSR mesh.

{{{

> WAN WAN
>
> :   |                                                   |
>
OpenWrt + OLSR Node 1 ---- wireless link ---- OpenWrt + OLSR Node 2

:   |                                                   |

LAN LAN

:   |                                                   |

> Workstation A Workstation B

}}}

Both nodes (in this case the \["OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Linksys/WRT54GL"\]
was used) need to have OLSR installed. In general, OLSR will have to be
installed on any node that participates in establishing routing between
the OLSR-aware subnets that you configure. OLSR needs to be configured
to listen on all WIFI interfaces on these routers. Running it on wired
interfaces is usually not necessary, and according to some sources may
interfere with other services on these interfaces such as dhcp.

If the "wired" interfaces on your router are on a different subnet from
the wireless interfaces you can configure OLSR to distribute ''host and
network association'' (HNA) messsages to other routers. Depending on if
if you are running IPv4 or IPv6 you will either have Hna4 or Hna6
directives in your olsrd.conf file.

= HOW TO =

1.  Setting up wireless on your router

You will have to configure wireless networking on your router. If you
are on a Kamikaze release, your file /etc/config/wireless might look as
follows:

{{{ config wifi-device wl0 option type broadcom option channel 11 \#
disable radio to prevent an open ap after reflashing: option disabled 0

config wifi-iface

:   option device wl0 \# option network lan option mode adhoc option
    ssid OLSR option hidden 0 option encryption none

}}}

After a fresh install of OpenWrt, you'll probably have to enable the
wireless interface by modifying the "option disabled" line. You'll also
have to change the wireless interface to adhoc mode from the default of
"ap".

You'll also have to separate the wifi and lan interfaces. This is done
by in Ad Hoc mode with Lan and Wifi seperate (ie. no br0)

1.  Install olsrd

Assuming that you have OpenWrt installed and correctly configured (e.g.,
your ipkg configuration is correct), you can see which olsrd package is
available in the ipkg repositories that you have access to:

{{{

:   ipkg update ipkg list | grep olsrd

}}}

You should see a number of olsr-related packages. The package named
"olsrd" is the primary daemon process, and the others that you see such
as olsrd-mod-dyn-gw are plugins (olsrd is very extensible and has great
plugin support).

Assuming that you saw an olsrd package after the command above, install
it with {{{ipkg install olsrd}}}.

2.  Edit the /etc/olsrd.conf file

You will see a line in your olsrd.conf file that says {{{Interface
"XXX"}}}. Change "XXX" to the wireless interface on your router. In my
case, this was wl0.

The rest of the defaults in the file should work. Try
{{{/etc/init.d/olsrd start}}} to see if it works.

Below is the full olsrd.conf that I use on my production system:

3.  Configuring the firewall for OLSR

You will have to make some changes to /etc/firewall.user for your OLSR
mesh to function. This will allow the router to forward packets between
the interfaces, including the WIFI and LAN interfaces that you separated
earlier.

The following is an example firewall.user that was supplied for what
appears to be a WhiteRussian system, however it will not work on
Kamikaze:

{{{ \#!/bin/sh . /etc/functions.sh

> WAN=\$(nvram get wan\_ifname) LAN=\$(nvram get lan\_ifname)
> WIFI=\$(nvram get wifi\_ifname)
>
> iptables -F input\_rule iptables -F output\_rule iptables -F
> forwarding\_rule iptables -t nat -F prerouting\_rule iptables -t nat
> -F postrouting\_rule

\# For forwarding WAN (internet) to WIFI

> iptables -A forwarding\_rule -i \$WAN -o \$WIFI -j ACCEPT

\# READER'S NOTE: After testing the above setting setting and not
getting it to work I used the following line which seems to work fine. I
remember noticing a comment somewhere stating that using '-i \$WAN' is
ignored, which could have been the cause. Notice that they are opposite.
If only one of these settings are truely correct, please verify and
remove the offending line.

> iptables -A forwarding\_rule -i \$WIFI -o \$WAN -j ACCEPT

\#For forwarding LAN & WIFI in nodes

iptables -A forwarding\_rule -i \$LAN -o \$WIFI -j ACCEPT

\#For WIFI clients to connect to node

iptables -A forwarding\_rule -i \$WIFI -o \$WIFI -j ACCEPT

\#For connecting a Wired Lan client of node 1 to wired client of node 2

iptables -A forwarding\_rule -i \$LAN -o \$LAN -j ACCEPT

}}}

The above won't work on Kamikaze in particular because nvram is no
longer used for system configuration in this system. Following is a
firewall.user for a kamikaze system. It works for an OLSR mesh running
Kamikaze r7509.

{{{ \#!/bin/sh

Now reboot your router for the changes to take effect.

4.  Running OLSR on startup

After you have installed and configured olsrd to your liking, make it
run when the router boots. The debug level must be set to "0" in the
olsrd.conf file for it to start. Next, make a symbolic link in /etc/rc.d
to the startup script:

{{{ ln -s /etc/init.d/olsrd /etc/rc.d/S60olsrd }}}

5.  Reboot and test

Reboot your router and test everything by pinging interfaces on the
different devices. Go and have a beverage of choice to celebrate!

= Configuration Notes and Tips =

> -   The configuration above seems to work on Kamikaze only when the
>     "Internet" (WAN) port on each Linksys wrt54g is used. There seem
>     to be iptables issues preventing the lan ports from working
>     properly.
> -   Kamikaze (up to release 7509) doesn't calculate broadcast
>     addresses properly. These need to be explicitly coded in to the
>     /etc/config/network file for each interface as "broadcast x.x.x.x"
>     parameters.

= After basic configuration =

You may want to check out some of the plugins that are easy to configure
and show you the basic status of your mesh. On my network I run
olsrd-mod-httpinfo, which provides a basic http server that shows you
the status of the mesh.
