The Optware collection ports approximately 1000 application packages to
embedded Linux; this collection originally was part of the Unslung
environment in nslu2-linux.org's 'slug' project.

As the packages are rather large, they are best suited for a USB-capable
device with external storage (see UsbStorageHowto) or SD/MMC card flash.

Before beginning installation, mount a writeable partition (flash or
hard disc) as /opt - if you have a hard disc, you may also want to
create a swap partition.

=== Installation for Whiterussian === Once this is ready, download the
ipkg-opt installer using:

{{{

:   wget <http://pastebin.ca/raw/891052> -O - | tr -d 'r' &gt;
    /tmp/optware-install.sh; sh /tmp/optware-install.sh

}}} '''''Note:''' ipkg-opt\_0.99.163-'''9'''\_mipsel.ipk used in the
script is outdated and not available from that source, use
ipkg-opt\_0.99.163-'''10'''\_mipsel.ipk instead.''

Upon successful install, you should be able to download a list of
packages with:

{{{

:   ipkg-opt update

}}} The installation of individual packages from the collection is then
done using a similar procedure to standard ipkg installation, but using
ipkg-opt.

The created /opt/etc/ipkg.conf contains:

{{{

:   src/gz optware
    <http://ipkg.nslu2-linux.org/feeds/optware/ddwrt/cross/stable> dest
    /opt/ /

}}} This ensures that ipkg-opt downloaded packages will be placed under
/opt/bin, /opt/lib, /opt/sbin instead of in the root filesystem.

The Optware packages appear to be mostly compatible with OpenWRT
Whiterussian installations, although problems occasionally will occur
with differences in library files between the various distributions.

You may also want to update /etc/profile to add
:/opt/bin:/opt/usr/bin:/opt/sbin to your \$PATH variable.

=== Installation for Kamikaze === Packages designed for use under the
2.4 kernel (OpenWRT/Whiterussian) may not be compatible with newer
versions of the operating environment.

There are some packages available for the current Kamikaze release here:

ARM/IXScale:

{{{ src Optware
<http://ipkg.nslu2-linux.org/feeds/openwrt/kamikaze-7.09> }}} Broadcom
(2.4)

{{{ src Optware
<http://ipkg.nslu2-linux.org/feeds/optware/openwrt-brcm24/cross/unstable>
}}} Note: Not all platforms are supported yet under Kamikaze.
