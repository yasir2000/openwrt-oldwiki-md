= Writing a startup script =

The boot process may be customized to add new daemons, provide alternate
ways of starting existing daemons, or otherwise do things at startup and
shutdown.

This, is /etc/init.d/example. As written it supports all standard
options, e.g, 'restart', 'enable', etc. as well as 'start' and 'stop'.:

{{{ \#!/bin/sh /etc/rc.common \# Example script \# Copyright (C) 2007
OpenWrt.org

START=10 STOP=15

start() {

:   echo start \# commands to launch application

}

stop() {

:   echo stop \# commands to kill application

}
=

After creating it, run {{{chmod a+x /etc/init.d/example}}} to make it
executable. Then run {{{/etc/init.d/example enable}}}, this creates a
link to the script in the {{{/etc/rc.d/}}} directory. The {{{START=10}}}
means that this will become {{{/etc/init.d/S10example}}} - the 10
signifies the order the script is to be executed, allowing it to be
placed before or after existing scripts. The {{{STOP=15}}} is optional
and will create a {{{/etc/rc.d/K15example}}}.

On startup, all the scripts matching the pattern /etc/rc,d/S\* are
executed in the form of "&lt;script&gt; boot", which will run the
commands in the start() section. On shutdown the /etc/rc.d/K\* scripts
are executed as "&lt;script&gt; stop" causing the stop() section to be
run.

Here's a few commands to illustrate the use -

{{{ /etc/init.d/example /etc/init.d/example enable /etc/init.d/example
boot /etc/init.d/example start /etc/init.d/example restart
/etc/init.d/example stop /etc/init.d/example disable }}}

Additionally, you can define a boot() section -

{{{ boot() { echo boot \# commands to run at boot

> \# continue with the start() section start

> }

}}} Now, running the script with the boot argument will trigger the
boot() section (which then triggers the start section). This allows you
to run additional commands at bootup, avoiding them on the restart
command.

= Custom functions in init scripts =

/etc/init.d/example

{{{ \#!/bin/sh /etc/rc.common \# Example script \# Copyright (C) 2007
OpenWrt.org

START=10 STOP=15

EXTRA\_COMMANDS="custom" EXTRA\_HELP=" custom HELP text for custom"

start() {

:   echo start \# commands to launch application

}

stop() {

:   echo stop \# commands to kill application

}

custom() {

:   echo custom function \# do something

}
=

{{{ <root@OpenWrt>:/\# /etc/init.d/example Syntax: /etc/init.d/example
\[command\]

Available commands:

:   start Start the service stop Stop the service restart Restart the
    service reload Reload configuration files (or restart if that fails)
    enable Enable service autostart disable Disable service autostart
    custom HELP text for custom
