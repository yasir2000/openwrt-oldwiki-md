\~+'''Wake-On-LAN !HowTo'''+\~

\[\[TableOfContents\]\]

= General = Wake-On-LAN (short WOL) can be used to awake a network
machine (computer, printer, etc.) from standby mode over the network
with a "magic packet". Lots of information about WOL can be found on
\[<http://gsd.di.uminho.pt/jpo/software/wakeonlan/mini-howto/> José
Pedro Oliveira's Wake on LAN mini HOWTO\]. When something is not
explained here, then it is already documented in José's WOL !HowTo.

Before setting up !OpenWrt to wake up your machines, you should test if
your machines can be waked up at all. Test this from another machine on
your LAN. Use the information and tools from José's !HowTo mentioned
above, e.g. AMDs Magic Packet tool.

As of October 2007 there is only a {{{wol}}} package for Kamikaze. There
is no {{{ether-wake}}} package yet, but it is already reported in
\[<https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/2460> ticket 2460\]. For the old White
Russian release you find {{{ether-wake}}} in the
\[<ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/xwrt/packages> X-Wrt WR backport
repository\].

= Setting up OpenWrt for WOL = With {{{wol}}} you can send a magic
packet via IP. For this you have to know the broadcasting address of
your network, e.g. 10.1.255.255 for a 10.1.0.0/16 network.

== Installation == For {{{wol}}} install the following package

{{{ ipkg install wol }}}

== Usage == To awake a machine with {{{wol}}} use

{{{ wol -h &lt;broadcast address&gt; &lt;mac address of the target&gt;
(e.g. wol -h 10.1.255.255 11:22:33:44:55:66) }}} If doesn't work have a
look at your network topology and check if the packet is forwarded to
the router/switch the target is connected to.

Note: Maybe you are lucky and it even works without the broadcast
address, but do not count on it.

== Easy Usage == Make sure your /etc/hosts and /etc/ethers files are
populated properly.

Save the following script to /usr/bin/wake

{{{ \#!/bin/ash if \[ -z "\$1" \]; then echo Usage: \$0 hostname exit fi

sucky\_resolve () { grep -i \$1 /etc/hosts | awk '{ print \$1 }' }
sucky\_ether () { grep -i \$1 /etc/ethers | awk '{ print \$1 }' }
broadcast\_ip4 () { echo \$IPADDRESS | sed s/.\[0-9\]\*\$/.255/ }

IPADDRESS=\`sucky\_resolve \$1\`

:   ETHER=\`sucky\_ether \$IPADDRESS\`

BROADCAST=\`broadcast\_ip4 \$IPADDRESS\` wol -i \$BROADCAST \$ETHER }}}

Set the executable bit {{{ chmod +x /usr/bin/wake }}}

And now you should just be able to wake machines by using their hostname
{{{ <root@openwrt>:\~\# wake aeris Waking up 00:99:d4:0f:dc:62...
<root@openwrt>:\~\# }}}
