I've got two PowerNOC WOAP54G units for a point to point data link on my farm, and I've successfully installed OpenWrt White Russian RC3, RC4 and RC5 on them.

I've figured out that to monitor the RSSI and noise I needed to install the [http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/packages/non-free/ non-free] wl package.  But I don't know how to change transmit power yet.

Another problem I'm researching is that with a WDS link set up, I cannot seem to prevent clients from associating with the AP at either end of the link. [:OpenWrtDocs/Configuration] section 3.4 isn't clear on it.

I've also ported the Netrek Vanilla Server to !OpenWrt.
