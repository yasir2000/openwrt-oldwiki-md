__About Me__
 * Name: James Cameron, developer on other projects, an !OpenWrt user,
 * Web page: [http://quozl.linux.org.au/ home page],
 * Email: quozl@us.netrek.org and james.cameron@hp.com,
  * you can mail me about anything that has my name on it, and if your question is interesting then you may get a reply,
  * to make your question interesting, read Eric Raymond's [http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html How To Ask Questions The Smart Way] (but please don't write to that document's authors!),
  * don't mail me about mistakes in this Wiki, fix the problem yourself, by registering and then editing the page.

I've got two PowerNOC WOAP54G units for a point to point data link on my farm, and I've successfully installed !OpenWrt White Russian RC3, RC4 and RC5 on them.  I've also got an Asus WL-HDD and two Minitar access points.

A problem I'm researching is that with a WDS link set up, I cannot seem to prevent clients from associating with the AP at either end of the link. [:OpenWrtDocs/WhiteRussian/Configuration] section 3.4 isn't clear on it.

I've also ported the Netrek Vanilla Server to !OpenWrt.

 * [http://quozl.linux.org.au/netrek binary tarball, package source, work in progress] (Why is my ipkg file empty?  I probably did something aggravating to the build process.)
