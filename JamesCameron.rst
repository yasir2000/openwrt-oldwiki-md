I've got two PowerNOC WOAP54G units for a point to point data link on my farm, and I've successfully installed OpenWrt White Russian RC3 on them.

I've figured out that to monitor the RSSI and noise I needed to install the [http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/packages/non-free/ non-free] wl package.  But I don't know how to change transmit power yet.
