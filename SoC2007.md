== Complete AR7Port ==

Take a step forward on \[:AR7Port\] by booting a linux kernel on
\[:OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/ZyXEL/Prestige\_660HW-61\]. The findings on this
platform will be useful for other AR7-based router brands.

Most work around this device has been done using
\[<http://www.ixo.de/info/zyxel_uclinux/> uCLinux\], but now it's time
to get OpenWRT working on it and get its main hardware components
supported:

> -   Filesystem mountpoints (flash map)
> -   ADSL
> -   ACX100 WIFI

In addition, firmware flashing scripts are needed for this router
series: CRC signatures used by the device's web firmware flasher have
already been identified. These scripts will avoid the need to build a
cable to flash the firmware.

Again, all these findings should be useful for several
\[<http://wiki.openwrt.org/CategoryAR7Device> other brands using the
same chip\], not just for this particular device.

Skills required:

:   -   Basic electronics (needed to build a serial cable with a TTL
        level inverter)
    -   Knowledge about MIPS architecture
    -   Good level at C and MIPS assembly
