Dude, what's with the name?  A joke, well, stuck to me.  Note that this wiki seems to think my name is evil (it seems to not like chicken)


Currently bricking:

||grey01||[wiki:Self:Hardware/Linksys/WRTSL54GS wrtsl54gs]||WhiteRussian-rc6||need to WPA, UPnP, USB, SIP, and connect via Motorola HT820 :) ||
||grey02||[wiki:Self:Hardware/Linksys/WRTSL54GS wrtsl54gs]||||successfully bricked, HairyDairyMaid-proof||

The SDK doesn't quite work on MacOSX

WRTSL54GS required some post-ISL edits (so I remember):
 * ipkg install lsusb kmod-vfat kmod-usb-storage kmod-usb-ohci
 * reboot ("insmod kmod-usb-ohci" seems to hang)
 * mounts whatever it finds on the USB chain, even through HUBs (unlike Linksys and XBox)
 * still no UPnP, Gaim/Adium via NAT seems to go
