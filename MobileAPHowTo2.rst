Soon after receiving the new WRTSL54GS and getting OpenWRT running on it (thanks Kaloz)
my thoughts turned to the many uses for the USB port. One obvious one was using a cellular
phone to attach to the internet, for mobile WiFi!

Items that I had:
1. WRTSL54GS with OpenWRT
2. Nokia 6230 cellphone with data server
3. USB data cable that connects to POP-port on phone

Steps:

1) Need to get USB-serial module installed

ipkg install kmod-usb-serial
insmod usbserial

2) Get cellphone recognized

logread shows recognized, but not fully:
