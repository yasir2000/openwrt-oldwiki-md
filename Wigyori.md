Unix admin located in Budapest, Hungary, working for a large telco
company. Contributing to OpenWrt a few times - at least for soldering
Kaloz's stuff, writing smaller patches -, also playing with AVR32 and
SuperH-based embedded stuff. Short range plans include an X.org 7.2
compiled with uClibc, mostly for OpenWrt and OpenMoko.
