 * Used to package various things, sometimes useful, sometimes not, even broken at times
 * Started a SoekrisPort
 * Wants to add a generic x86 port (feel free to support him and express your interest)
  * I'll second that (lschweiss).  OpenWRT is becoming a great networking platform that is usable well beyond small routers.  A generic x86 port can bring OpenWRT very powerful hardware.
