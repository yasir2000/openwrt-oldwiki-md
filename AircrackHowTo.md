Again, thanks for your help! '''Aircrack Quick Guide for the WRT54G/S'''

\[\[TableOfContents\]\]

= Introduction = == What is Aircrack? == Aircrack is a suite of tools
that enables wireless traffic monitoring and penetration/security
testing. The official page for \[<http://www.aircrack-ng.org> Aircrack\]
is www.aircrack-ng.org

= Requirements =

:   -   A WRT54G/S in client mode.
    -   aircrack package.
    -   {{{wl}}} utility.\[\[FootNote(Possible dependency.)\]\]
    -   External storage.\[\[FootNote(For example NFS or CIFS mounted
        drive. See RemoteFileSystemHowTo for instructions on how to set
        this up.)\]\]

= Installation = Aircrack can easily be installed using !OpenWrt
backports repository. See \["OpenWrtDocs/Packages"\] for how to
configure your device to use the repository, then install aircrack by
typing: {{{ ipkg install aircrack-ng }}} If you have a
\[<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_%28chipset%29> PRISM\] chipset, in
order to capture traffic, you need {{{wl}}}. This can be installed by
typing: {{{ ipkg install wl }}} Likewise, Atheros/MadWIFI users need
wlanconfig. This *should* be in either kmod-madwifi or wireless-tools.

= Configuring Your WRT54G/S to Monitor = Now that Aircrack is installed
and ready to start capturing traffic, you have to tell your router to
listen to all traffic and not just traffic of its own. This is called
"monitor mode." To be able to change channels and sniff on all channels,
you must have the router in client mode:
\["OpenWrtDocs/WhiteRussian/ClientMode"\]
\["OpenWrtDocs/Kamikaze/ClientMode"\]

Users with a Broadcom chipset need to use the {{{wl}}} utility: {{{ wl
monitor 1 ifup prism0 }}}

Users with an Atheros chipset need to use {{{wlanconfig}}}: {{{
wlanconfig ath1 create wlandev wifi0 wlanmode monitor }}}

MadWIFI allows you you have virtual interfaces, provided they are on the
same channel. This is why ath1 is specified. All Atheros chipset cards
have a wifi&lt;instance&gt; device, and each device can have multiple
ath devices.

= Start Capturing = Begin by changing into the directory that you want
to store the dump file in. This is most likely the directory that is
either a CIFS or NFS mount. The dump files can get large, and to capture
a useful amount of data you will need more storage than what comes stock
on these routers. Another reason and advantage for storing the dump file
on another computer is so the processing of the dumpfile can be done in
parallel with capturing.

Once you are in the directory that you want to store the dump file in,
run the following commands:

{{{ airodump prism0 test 0 1 }}}

What the above command does is:

> -   prism0 - Use device {{{prism0}}}
> -   test - Output to the file {{{test.cap}}} (the {{{.cap}}} is added
>     automatically)
> -   0 - Listen on all channels
> -   1 - Write only the IVs found and drop everything else

We want to only write the IVs found because they are the packets that
can be used to crack the WEP encryption.

After the command is run the Aircrack program starts to display
information about the surrounding networks to the user. The user will
see the ESSIDs of the surrounding networks and how many packets those
networks are sending.

During capture, the user can run the aircrack program on the
{{{test.cap}}} file using the computer that is hosting the network
storage. Using this method, both airodump and aircrack can be run in
parallel, without interfering with eachother.

Once you have enough packets logged just hit {{{CTRL+C}}} to quit
airodump.

= Airodump Usage = {{{ usage: airodump &lt;interface name or pcap
filename&gt; &lt;output prefix&gt; &lt;channel&gt; \[IVs flag\]}}}

Newer versions (like in the Kamikaze release) use a different syntax:
{{{ Airodump-ng 0.9 - (C) 2006,2007 Thomas d'Otreppe Original work:
Christophe Devine <http://www.aircrack-ng.org>
