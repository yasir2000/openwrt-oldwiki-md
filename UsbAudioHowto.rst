= USB Audio Support =

USB Capable routers such as the Asus WL-500g/gx support USB Audio adapters to turn your router into a networked music player.

USB Audio support entered OpenWRT CVS around Sept 2005, at the time of writing it is not included in any releases (eg. White Russian).

To use USB Audio you will need to build your own firmware using buildroot CVS.
