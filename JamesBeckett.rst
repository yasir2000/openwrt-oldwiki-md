I seem to have developed a liking for Netgear equipment.. they're not always the
most feature-rich or bug free devices, but I like the feel of them. The blue
metal boxed "for business" range, I mean - they have a pleasing solidity and
squareness to them. I like stuff that I can rackmount - rather than the funky
rounded-edge natty plastic desktop boxes.

I also like
   * SNMP. Many of the "home networking" boxes don't include this
   * Console access
   * Open Source (but you'd guessed that, seeing as we're both here).
