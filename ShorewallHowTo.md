''('''Kamikaze users''': This HowTo was originally written in 2004; it
applies to White Russian and Shorewall 2.09. Shorewall 3.4 is now
included in Kamikaze, and many things have changed. Until an updated
howto is written, Kamikaze users should probably run {{{ipkg install
shorewall}}} and continue at the
\[<http://www.shorewall.net/Documentation_Index.html> Shorewall
documentation pages\].)''

== Introduction ==

=== What is it? ===

\[<http://www.shorewall.net/> Shorewall\] is a popular set of shell
scripts used to ease configuration of an iptables based firewall, and
also allow a more complex set of firewall rules to be managed easily.

=== Why? ===

The default firewall for openwrt is very basic and not as robust as some
would like. Shorewall also configures some advanced functionalities (not
all supported by openwrt) that are harder to do by hand. Another
possible advantage is that automating shorewall configuration through a
web interface is not very hard.

== Quick Start (ipkg installation) == Instead of downloading and
modifiying the original shorewall, you can build and/or install the ipkg
I have made for OpenWRT. If you do you can skip the rest of the steps
below, and go straight to the
\[<http://www.shorewall.net/Documentation_Index.html> Shorewall
Documentation\] on how to further configure your firewall from the
defaults in the ipkg.

=== Installing the IPKG Package ===

Simply add the following line to {{{/etc/ipkg.conf}}}:{{{ src yani
<http://openwrt.wojjie.net/packages> }}}

Note: Another Shorewall package, of a more recent version, is available
at <http://openwrt.homelinux.net/>

and run:{{{ ipkg update ipkg install shorewall }}}

ipkg should install the dependencies (iproute2 and iptables-saverestore)
and procede to install shorewall. When completed you will be given
instructions to check your configuration and when happy add the RC
script so that it is loaded at boot time.

Make sure you have logging enabled as described in the Setting up
Logging MiniHowtos.

=== Building the IPKG Package ===

If you want to build and install your own shorewall ipk see
BuildingPackages to install an ipkg build environment and then:{{{ wget
<http://www.shorewall.net/pub/shorewall/2.0/shorewall-2.0.9/shorwall-2.0.9.lrp>
wget <http://openwrt.wojjie.net/src/iptables-saverestore.tar.gz> wget
<http://openwrt.wojjie.net/src/shorwall-2.0.9-ipkg.tar.gz> tar -xzvf
iptables-saverestore.tar.gz \#(if you have built iptables-save/restore
as shown below in howto) \#cp
&lt;buildrootpath&gt;/build\_mipsel/root/usr/sbin/iptables-\*
iptables-saverestore/usr/sbin/ fakeroot ipkg-build iptables-saverestore

mkdir ipkgroot cd ipkgroot tar -xzvf ../shorwall-2.0.9.lrp tar -xzvf
../shorwall-2.0.9-ipkg.tar.gz fakeroot ipkg-buildpackage -c cd .. }}}

And install:{{{ ipkg install iptables-saverestore\_1.0\_mipsel.ipk
shorewall\_2.0.9\_all.ipk }}}

== Requirements ==

You will require the following OpenWRT packages:

> -   iproute2 (ip\_2.0\_mipsel.ipk)

You may require the following OpenWRT packages if you want the associated features:

:   

    \* OpenVPN

    :   -   OpenVPN Packages
        -   Add line for \[<http://www.shorewall.net/OPENVPN.html>
            openvpn tunnel\] in {{{/etc/shorewall/tunnels}}}

    \* IPSEC VPN

    :   -   OpenSwan Packages (see OpenSwan HowTo)
        -   Add line for \[<http://www.shorewall.net/IPSEC.htm> ipsec
            tunnel\] in {{{/etc/shorewall/tunnels}}}

    \* IPV6 Tunnel

    :   -   IPV6 Kernel modules (kmod-ipv6\_2.4.20-1\_mipsel.ipk)
        -   IPT6 Kernel modules (kmod-ipt6\_2.4.20-1\_mipsel.ipk)
        -   Add line for \[<http://www.shorewall.net/6to4.htm> 6to4
            tunnel\] in {{{/etc/shorewall/tunnels}}}

    \* Traffic Shaping

    :   -   tc (tc\_2.0\_mipsel.ipk)
        -   Set {{{TC\_ENABLED=Yes}}} in {{{/etc/shorewall.conf}}}

First we need to download shorewall. I downloaded the latest stable
\[<http://www.shorewall.net/pub/shorewall/2.0/shorewall-2.0.9/shorwall-2.0.9.lrp>
(2.09) LRP package\]. The LRP package is made for the
\[<http://leaf.sourceforge.net/> Linux Embedded Appliance Firewall\]
project, and thus is particularly suited to the needs of OpenWRT. The
LRP Package is in fact just a tar.gz tarball, and you can rename it as
such.

On the OpenWRT router: {{{ cd /tmp wget
<http://www.shorewall.net/pub/shorewall/2.0/shorewall-2.0.9/shorwall-2.0.9.lrp>
mv shorwall-2.0.9.lrp shorwall-2.0.9.tar.gz }}}

== Installation == We can now simply extract the tarball into the root
of the router. Make sure you have enough space before preceding, I have
a WRT54GS so I'm a bit spoilt ;) : {{{ cd / tar -xzvf
/tmp/shorwall-2.0.9.tar.gz }}}

This will extract the following files:{{{ -rwx------ root/root 2249

The files under /var/lib are luckily LEAF specific, and part of the
lrpkg package format. These files are not needed and will in fact be
removed on the router's next reset since /var uses the router's ram
disk.

=== Replacing Printf === The default openwrt busybox comes with printf
removed, you have two choices:

> -   Recompile busybox with printf support, and copy /usr/bin/printf to
>     your router.
> -   Replace printf calls in shorewall with echo/awk statements.

The second of these is actually easier and saves you quite a bit of
space. The principle is that the printf that comes in the awk language
is essentially the same as bash's printf, and you can replace{{{ printf
'%7d %5d %sn' \$count \$port \$srv }}} with {{{ echo \$count \$port
\$srv | awk '{printf("%7d %5d %sn",\$1,\$2,\$3)}' }}}

You will need to do this a few times in /sbin/shorewall and
/usr/share/firewall.

=== Configuration === This is the important part. Before we can use the
shorewall firewall we will have to configure it so that it works on the
OpenWRT set of interfaces, and also add any firewall rules that we may
wish to have.

(Added by AndrewSteele: It's worth noting that you'll get strange errors
like this: {{{ Adding Common Rules iptables: No chain/target/match by
that name ERROR: Command "/usr/sbin/iptables -A smurfs -s 192.168.10.255
-j LOG --log-level info --log-prefix "Shorewall:smurfs:DROP:"" Failed
}}} If you have not loaded in the ipt\_LOG module. I've spent months (on
and off) trying to crack this!)

To do this first download the package which has the ipt\_LOG module {{{
ipkg install iptables-mod-extra }}} To load the module manually {{{
insmod ipt\_LOG.o }}} To load the module on startup create a file in
/etc/modules.d/ directory (eg 90-shorewall) containing this {{{
ipt\_LOG.o }}} ==== Configure Logging ==== The package we installed has
been preconfigured for a LEAF router which uses the ULOG logging daemon.
Thus the first change we need to make is to set shorewall to use
syslogd. If you havn't already got syslogd running/configured on your
system please see the mini-howto on "Setting up logging". The two files
that contain the references to ULOG are: {{{
etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf:LOGNEWNOTSYN=ULOG
etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf:MACLIST\_LOG\_LEVEL=ULOG
etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf:TCP\_FLAGS\_LOG\_LEVEL=ULOG
etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf:RFC1918\_LOG\_LEVEL=ULOG
etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf:SMURF\_LOG\_LEVEL=ULOG
etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf:BOGON\_LOG\_LEVEL=ULOG
etc/shorewall/policy:net all DROP ULOG etc/shorewall/policy:all all
REJECT ULOG }}}

Replace each occourance of {{{ULOG}}} with {{{info}}} or some other
valid Shorewall \[<http://www.shorewall.net/shorewall_logging.html>
logging level\].

==== Configure Interfaces ====

Since the WRT54G uses a very unusual set of interfaces (bridge of switch
and wireless used for internal network, etc) we will have to change the
default interface configuration. On my WRT54GS my WAN (Internet)
interface is {{{vlan1}}} and my LAN (internal interface) is {{{br0}}}.
This may be different fro you, the easiest way to find out is to run the
folling commands to find your WAN and LAN interfaces respectively:{{{
<root@OpenWrt>:\~\# nvram get wan\_ifname vlan1 <root@OpenWrt>:\~\#
nvram get lan\_ifname br0 }}}

===== /etc/shorewall/interfaces ===== Now we know our WAN and LAN
interfaces we can change configure Shorewall's interface configuration.
Change the lines in {{{/etc/shorewall/interfaces}}} from:{{{ net eth0
detect dhcp,routefilter,norfc1918 loc eth1 detect }}}

to (substitute vlan1, br0 for your WAN and LAN interfaces respectively
as found above):{{{ net vlan1 detect dhcp,routefilter,norfc1918 loc br0
detect dhcp,routeback }}}

The dhcp options allow dhcp traffic through the WAN and LAN interfaces
since our router attempts to get an address from the ISP through the WAN
interface and serves DHCP addresses to clients on the LAN interface. The
routeback option tells shorewall that the interface is virtual so it can
handle the traffic flow this causes.

===== /etc/shorewall/masq ===== We will also need to configure the
Masqueradeing rules with our interfaces, change the lines in
{{{/etc/shorewall/masq}}} from:{{{ eth0 eth1 }}} to (again substitute
vlan1, br0 for your WAN and LAN interfaces):{{{ vlan1 br0 }}} ====
Remove TOS Support ==== Since the OpenWRT iptables hasn't got support
for TOS, we have to remove the support from Shorewall, to do this
comment out (or remove) all lines from {{{/etc/shorewall/tos}}}, in my
case:{{{ \#all all tcp - ssh 16 \#all all tcp ssh - 16 \#all all tcp -
ftp 16 \#all all tcp ftp - 16 \#all all tcp ftp-data - 8 \#all all tcp -
ftp-data 8 }}}

==== Configure Firewall Rules ====

===== /etc/shorewall/rules ===== Finally we will want to customize the
firewall to a set of rules we define. You will probably want to start
out with this basic configuration which you can set in
{{{/etc/shorewall/rules}}}:{{{ \#ACTION SOURCE DEST PROTO DEST SOURCE
ORIGINAL RATE USER/ \# PORT PORT(S) DEST LIMIT GROUP \# PORT PORT(S)
DEST LIMIT

\# Accept DNS connections from the firewall to the network \# AllowDNS
fw net

\# Accept SSH connections from the local network for administration \#
AllowSSH loc fw

\# Accept SSH connections from the internet for administration
\#AllowSSH net fw

\# Allow Ping To And From Firewall to local network \# AllowPing loc fw
AllowPing fw loc AllowPing fw net

\# Allow Ping To Firewall from internet \# \#AllowPing net fw

\# \# OpenWRT specific rules: \# allow loc to fw udp/53 for
local/caching DNS servers to work \# allow loc to fw tcp/80 for weblet
to work \# allow loc to fw udp/67 and udp/68 for dnsmasq's dhcpd to work
AllowDNS loc fw AllowWeb loc fw

\# Allow syslogd to send messages to loghost in LAN \#ACCEPT fw loc udp
514

\#LAST LINE -- ADD YOUR ENTRIES BEFORE THIS ONE -- DO NOT REMOVE }}}

===== /etc/shorewall/routestopped ===== You will also probably want to
add the interface of your LAN to the {{{/etc/shorewall/routestopped}}}
file which tells Shorewall what interface to accept connections from
when the firewall is stopped (a good thing :) ). Without this shorewall
will keep any current connections open however for \`absent minded
administrators'.

Add the following to {{{/etc/shorewall/routestopped}}}:{{{ br0 -
routeback }}}

===== /etc/shorewall/policy ===== By default shorewall comes configured
so that the firewall hasn't got access to the internet itself for
increased security, however with OpenWRT we want access to the internet
if only to use the ipkg system. To allow access simply follow the
instructions in {{{/etc/shorewall/policy}}} and uncomment the line as
follows:{{{ \# If you want open access to the Internet from your
Firewall \# remove the comment from the following line. fw net ACCEPT
}}}

=== Starting Shorewall at boot time ===

To automatically start shorewall at boot time we will want to add an RC
script. Shorewall installs such a script in /etc/init.d/shorewall,
however we will want to modify this and rename it so that it works with
openWRT.

==== Editing RC Script ====

We can start with the shorewall rc script as a basis, first edit the
script {{{/etc/init.d/shorewall}}} and change it so that it looks like
this:{{{
\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#
\# Give Usage Information \#
\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#
usage() { echo "Usage: \$0 startrestart|status" exit 1 }

start() {

:   echo "Starting Shorewall Firewall" \#If saved rules exist, load them
    if \[ -e /etc/shorewall/restore \]; then mkdir -p /var/lib/shorewall
    cp /etc/shorewall/restore /var/lib/shorewall/ exec /sbin/shorewall
    restore | tee /var/log/shorewallstartup.log else \#create the rules
    and save them in the background exec /sbin/shorewall start |tee
    /var/log/shorewallstartup.log &&
     shorewall save && cp /var/lib/shorewall/restore /etc/shorewall/ &
    fi

}

\# E X E C U T I O N B E G I N S H E R E \#
===========================================

command="\$1"

mkdir -p /var/log touch /var/log/shorewall.log

case "\$command" in

:   

    start)

    :   start ;;

    stopstatus)

    :   exec /sbin/shorewall \$@ ;;

    \*)

    > usage ;;

esac

}}}

==== Speeding up Shorewall startup with iptables-restore ====

This script will attempt to restore Shorewall using a Shorewall restore
file (created using the command {{{shorewall save}}}) or will start
Shorewall and attempt to create a restore file. Since Shorewall takes a
long time to start (not restore) on the WRT54G it backgrounds this
process. This process seems to take up to a few minutes(!).

The {{{shorewall restore}}} and {{{shorewall save}}} script however use the {{{iptables-save}}} and {{{iptables-restore}}} commands that are unfortunately pruned to save space when OpenWRT is built. You will likely want to install these however instead of waiting a few minutes for your firewall to startup each time your router boots. To get the files you must download the latest OpenWRT sources and in the {{{buildroot/make/openwrt.mk}}} file uncomment the following lines:{{{

:   \# remove other unneeded files \#rm -f
    \$(TARGET\_DIR)/usr/sbin/iptables-save \#rm -f
    \$(TARGET\_DIR)/usr/sbin/iptables-restore

}}}

After building OpenWRT as normal, copy the files:{{{
buildroot/build\_mipsel/root/usr/sbin/iptables-save
buildroot/build\_mipsel/root/usr/sbin/iptables-restore }}}

to the {{{/usr/sbin/}}} directory on your router.

Now save the Shorewall configuration by starting our RC script:{{{
/etc/init.d/shorewall start }}}

Before proceding make sure your script works properly (so you don't end
up with a hung/inaccessible router on boot!) by starting and stopping
Shorewall using the RC script:{{{ /etc/init.d/shorewall stop
/etc/init.d/shorewall start }}} ==== Rename RC script so it is started
at boot ====

Now we have our script working properly we must rename it so it is run
on startup. First remove the file/symbolic link
{{{/etc/init.d/S45firewall}}}, there is a backup of the original file at
/rom/etc/init.d/S45firewall and rename our script to S45shorewall:{{{ rm
/etc/init.d/S45firewall mv /etc/init.d/shorewall
/etc/init.d/S45shorewall }}}

And we are finally done :) . Reboot the router and cross your fingers...

== Adding Traffic Shaping == Note: I am a newbie when it comes to TC and
shorewall, but what I have works so here it is:

=== About Traffic Shaping === It is important to note that when you are
running services that are very time/bandwidth sensitive that QoS or
traffic shaping is very important. The rules below are a good example to
customize to your requirements; however, I will describe the design
point that I used as I think it will match most people's requirements.

==== Traffic Shaping in General ==== The simple way of thinking of
traffic shaping is this: Consider all your traffic coming into a
"router" of sorts. This Router is aware of the types of traffic and will
seperate it into a series of buckets. The buckets all have a hole in the
bottom to allow this sorted traffic through; however, these are special
holes: \* If bucket 1 has traffic in it, that traffic will flow,
ignoring any traffic sitting in bucket 2 or 3. \* If bucket 1 is empty,
and bucket 2 has traffic. Bucket 2's traffic will flow ignoring bucket 3
and, \* If bucket 1 and 2 are empty, then the traffic in bucket 3 will
flow.

Thus 1 will always get priority.

==== My Setup ====

:   -   I run a network where my main phone line is based on VoIP with
        an asterisk server and multiple internal and external
        extensions.
    -   I run a webserver, mail server and other standard services
    -   I run a few workstations that browse the internet
    -   I have a system that is dedicated to P2P applications

Obviously I want my voice converstaions to be perfect and uninterrupted, and my P2P applications to use only unused bandwidth and not impact any of my other communications. Thus here is how I will make 3 buckets to prioritize my traffic:

:   1.  VoIP traffic
    2.  Default traffic
    3.  P2P traffic

=== OpenWRT Configuration ===

:   '''Requirements:'''

-   tc

- shorewall Note: You do not require the wondershaper.

==== Shorewall Configuration ==== Shorewall has the ability to setup all
of the traffic shaping items; however, the package that is available for
the openwrt doesnt seem to setup the classes or qdisc portions. (only
the tcrules file is processed), so we will use a combination of a
manually setup tcstart script and the tcrules processed by shorewall.
===== /etc/shorewall/modules ===== Add the following lines to this file
to add the required support{{{ \* loadmodule ipt\_LOG \# Take care of
logging issues noted above }}} ===== /etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf =====
set the following:{{{ \* TC\_ENABLED=Yes \* CLEAR\_TC=Yes }}} =====
/etc/shorewall/tcrules ===== It is important to note that the
'''Marks''' here are in decimal; however in the TCStart Script they are
in hexdecimal: Thus 16 dec = 10 hex, 48 dec = 30 hex. Set the following:

status -- This will give you the status of your "buckets" \* iptables
--show -t mangle -- This will show you your "marking rules" for bucket
sorting

===== Other useful points ===== Notice that we are only shaping outgoing
traffic -- As it may make sense to shape incoming traffic, you need to
stop and think a moment. We need to receive the incoming traffic before
we can shape it, and our LAN is not bandwidth limited like our WAN
connection, so why bother shape it? We have already received it...

Thankfully 95% of our latency issues surround two things: 1) incoming
connection rate and 2) upload rate. For 1, with proper configuration of
our p2p clients we can handle this. For 2, the above script works well.
