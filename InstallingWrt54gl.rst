= Introduction =
This guide is intended for beginners to Linux and/or OpenWrt.  This guide is dedicated to the installation of OpenWrt on the LinkSys WRT54GL router.  
Installation of OpenWrt on the WRT54GL is possible either through the Firmware upgrade web interface on the LinkSys router or through tftp on Windows or Linux.  The easiest method by far is installation through the web interface, mainly because of the small window of opportunity to connect and transfer OpenWrt using tftp.  The problems of using tftp for installation on the  Wrt54GL and how to overcome those problems are discussed here as well.
