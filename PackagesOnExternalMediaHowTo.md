\[\[TableOfContents\]\] = Introduction = == What is this Howto? == This
howto describes the process of installing and using packages on external
media as well as the internal media. I used this information to install
packages on my SD card. There is another howto that makes everything run
from the external media:
<http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/KamikazeConfiguration/PackagesOnExternalMediaHowTo>

== What External Media Can I Use? == I used this technique for my SD
card mod. However, I assume that the same (or similar) can be used for
just about any external media, but I have not tried.

For USB-capable routers, a wide array of flash and hard-disc options are
available. Each has advantages and disadvantages; a hard disc holds more
and can be used to provide a swap partition, while a flash device (or a
flash card and reader) is small, silent and has no moving parts. Flash
is quick to read but slow to write, not subject to mechanical failure
but subject to wear and failure if the same pages are written more than
10000-1000000 times. If working with modified hardware, a flash tag
(capacities currently of up to 16Gb) could easily be concealed within
the router enclosure with nothing visible externally; for instance,
there is a second USB port on the WRTSL54GS which is missing only the
4-pin connector and could serve this purpose well.

= Formatting the Media = While this step may not be needed, I preferred
to have an ext2 file system to better support various links and other
\*nix specific features.

To format the media I installed the e2fsprogs package from the White
Russian's backports repository. How to use the backports repository see
\["OpenWrtDocs/Packages"\].

{{{ ipkg install e2fsprogs }}}

Once installed you can format the target partition like this

{{{ mkfs.ext2 /dev/mmc/disc0/part1 }}}

Replace '/dev/mmc/disc0/part1' with the device that you want to format.

= Mount the Drive = == Loading the Ext2 Kernel Module == Once the drive
is formatted the kernel module needs to be installed and loaded for the
partition to be used. Install and load the kmod-ext2 package with the
following commands

{{{ ipkg install kmod-ext2 insmod ext2 }}}

To load the Ext2 module automatically on every boot

{{{ echo 'ext2' &gt; /etc/modules.d/30-ext2 }}}

== Mounting == When mounting a mount-point is needed. A mount-point is
the folder where the device will be attached. Once mounted the device
will appear to e inside this folder. A typical place to put these points
is in the /mnt folder. Since I am using this for my SD card my mount
point is /mnt/sd. Create the mount point for your installation like
this:

{{{ mkdir -p /mnt/sd }}}

To make mounting in the future easier it is best to create an entry in
the /etc/fstab file. Since the file is not in the default install of
OpenWrt you will probably have to create it. Add the following line to
/etc/fstab.

{{{ /dev/mmc/disc0/part1 /mnt/sd ext2 defaults 0 0 }}}

Replace '/dev/mmc/disc0/part1' with the device that you want to mount
and '/mnt/sd' with the mount-point you made above.

Mount the drive using the following command:

{{{ mount /dev/mmc/disc0/part1 /mnt/sd }}}

To mount the drive automatically on boot, we create a start script (in
/etc/init.d) and a link that executes this script. You can use the
following commands:

{{{ echo 'mount /dev/mmc/disc0/part1 /mnt/sd' &gt;
/etc/init.d/externalmount chmod +x /etc/init.d/externalmount ln -s
/etc/init.d/externalmount /etc/rc.d/S60externalmount }}}

= Configuring ipkg = To install packages to the external drive, add the
following line in /etc/ipkg.conf

{{{ dest sd /mnt/sd }}}

Where the syntax of the above line is "dest \[name of destination\]
\[destination\]". The "name of destination" can be anything you want, I
chose "sd" as I am using the SD card.

If using the \["Optware"\] packages, the device should be mounted as
/opt as the supplied ipkg-opt script already is coded to look in
/opt/etc/ipkg.conf for configuration and download packages to /opt by
default.

= Modifying Your Environment = In the file /etc/profile, modify the line
that reads

{{{ export PATH=/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin }}}

to read

{{{ export
PATH=/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/mnt/sd/bin:/mnt/sd/sbin:/mnt/sd/usr/bin:/mnt/sd/usr/sbin
}}}

Note: as with everything else in this howto you must replace /mnt/sd
with YOUR mount-point.

Also in /etc/profile, add the following line:

{{{ export LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH=/lib:/usr/lib:/mnt/sd/lib:/mnt/sd/usr/lib
}}}

= Installing Packages = To install packages to the external drive use
the -d option and specify the destination name that you created earlier.
An example of the command for my setup is

{{{ ipkg -d sd install tcpdump }}}

= Using the Packages = To use the packages just execute them as if they
were installed on the local drive. In the "Modifying Your Environment"
section of this guide you set the needed variables to allow the system
to recognize programs installed on the external drive.
