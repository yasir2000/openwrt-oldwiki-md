THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS.

If correctly following the instructions in this tutorial you will get a
hotspot with captive portal and user management running stand alone on
Kamikaze 7.06. No external server or persistency mechanism will be
required.

For much hardware this will be quite a suite of deamons to handle and
might very well run out of space halfway this tuturial. On the authors
WRT54GL with clean 2.4 kamikaze 7.06 flash there was 60K available for
website and userdatabse on jffs after install using ipkg. 800K free when
building firmware with all applications in squashfs.

= Chillispot =

\[Chillispot <http://www.chillispot.info/>\] is a fully loaded user
network connection management suit.

Using ipfilter it ensures that only authenticated connections have
access to the network. All unauthenticated http/https connections are
captured and sent to a login script. This is known as a captive portal.

Traffic from clients is routed from the interface (in this case
{{{wl0}}}) via a tunnel (here known as {{{tun0}}}) in wich per user
shaping and filters can be applied. These settings, and all user meta
data, is stored in a RADIUS. In this tutorial I will use FreeRADIUS and
its plain text file database module.

= Installing =

{{{ <root@OpenWRT>:/\# ipkg install chillispot }}}

This will install a minimal Chillispot distribution.

By default it sets up the client network 192.168.182.0/24 on {{{tun0}}}.
Do not attempt to change this to the same range as your internal LAN.
The first two IP-addresses in the range is reserved (.1 is the client
gateway, your WRT) and will not be leased out by Chillispots built in
DHCP.

It comes with a huge chilli.conf. You can replace it with something like
this:

/etc/chilli.conf {{{ <root@master>:/\# cat /etc/chilli.conf
radiusserver1 127.0.0.1 radiusserver2 127.0.0.1 radiussecret testing123
dhcpif wl0 dns1 192.168.182.1 dns1 192.168.182.2 uamanydns uamsecret
testing123 uamserver <https://192.168.182.1/cgi-bin/hotspotlogin.cgi>
}}}

The tunneled interface must not be bridged to the network. Simply
comment out {{{out option net lan}}} in your configutation file for the
hotspot interface.

/etc/config/wireless {{{ config wifi-device wl0 option type broadcom
option channel 8

config wifi-iface

:   option device wl0

\# option network lan

:   option mode ap option ssid OpenWRT option hidden 0 option encryption
    none

}}}

This is in most cases all the Chillispot configuration you need to
bother about. However, Chillispot have a few package dependencies you
need to set up and tweak in order for everthing to run smooth of your
WRT.

= Prerequisites to start =

== SSL enabled HTTPd ==

The hotspot login CGI requires SSL. I choose mini-httpd-ssl because it
was the smallest solution counted in bytes on jffs..

{{{ <root@OpenWRT>:/\# ipkg install mini-httpd-ssl }}}

> -   Create new PEM-cert if you don't want the default MyRouter.
> -   An empty index.html might be a good thing in all directories.

== perl ==

The hotspot login CGI is written in perl, a rather large piece of
software to install on small devices. Instead I choose microperl, perl
with no packages.

> -   stripped MD5.pw
> -   integer.pw

== FreeRADIUS ==

> -   ipkg install freeradius
> -   radiusd.conf - auth not needed when radiusd and chilli is on same
>     machine
> -   users - managemnt
