\[<http://www.openfsg.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=22663#22663> supports\]
this device as of Kamikaze 7.07.''' Freecom has shown a friendly
attitude towards the opensource community and they're willing to help us
with few restrictions (no additional warranty replacements due to hacked
devices, no extra tech support questions due to customizations and no
unfair advantage provided to competitors).

== Hardware ==

:   -   Intel XScale IXP422 at 266MHz with hardware encryption
    -   64MB RAM and 4MB flash
    -   Four port Realtek RTL8305SB switch configured as one WAN port
        and three LAN ports. Uses two XScale NPEs (eg. not VLANs like
        most WLAN APs)
    -   NEC USB 2.0 on PCI-bus. Four external (two front, two back) and
        one internal (empty pads on PCB)
    -   VIA VT6421A IDE controller on PCI-bus. One external eSATA, one
        internal PATA. Empty pads on PCB for secondary SATA bus
    -   Internal HDD. Various sizes available (80G, 160G, 250G, 400G,
        500G)
    -   Empty Mini-PCI socket on PCB for WLAN option. Stock firmware
        supports only Marvell based cards.
    -   Power button, Unplug button and Reset button. On PCB there's
        SYNC button pads
    -   Six user controllable leds (HDD, power, USB, USB unplug, WAN,
        WLAN)
    -   Small approx. 3cm \* 3cm fan
    -   JTAG connector (pin-out available,
        <http://www.nslu2-linux.org/wiki/FSG3/HomePage> and on
        <http://www.openfsg.com>)
    -   TTL serial connector and other port configurations available at
        <http://www.openfsg.com> and on
        <http://www.nslu2-linux.org/wiki/FSG3/HomePage>
    -   Winbond W83782D environment monitoring chip with three
        temperature sensors and fan RPM monitoring+control
    -   Onboard RTC with removable battery on I2C bus

== Software ==

:   -   FSG-3 uses RedBoot bootloader and runs bigendian SnapGear Linux
        3.1.6 based on 2.4.27 kernel. Freecom told they're going to
        upgrade to 2.6 kernel during 2006.
    -   There's various add-ons and GPL download on
        \[<http://www.openfsg.com/> <http://www.openfsg.com>\]

== Status ==

:   -   2.6.16 patched and running (based on SlugOS 3.10-beta)
    -   Network interfaces and switch work (0,1,2=LAN, 3=LAN/NPE, 4=WAN)
    -   MAC addresses for network interfaces correctly read from flash
    -   SATA and PATA disks work (with slightly modified Fedora Core 4
        patch from VIA)
    -   USB ports work with stock USB drivers
    -   WIFI card on Mini-PCI slot detected by kernel, and madwifi
        drivers confirmed working for Atheros cards. (Also tested with
        Intel, but haven't tried loading drivers yet)
    -   Freecom registered proper ARM Linux machine ID for FSG-3 (1091)
    -   I2C, RTC, sensors and FAN rpm control working with stock drivers
    -   Full tutorial
        \[<http://www.openfsg.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=22663#22663>
        available\] for installation without requiring hardware
        modifications

== ToDo ==

:   -   Enable buttons (GPIO's known, need to adapt NSLU2 code)
    -   Leds (Connected to expansion bus, needs some new code to
        support)
    -   Hardware crypto (Driver downloadable from Intel but does it work
        in Little-Endian mode?)

== Notes ==

:   

    \* Holding reset button while powering on enables recovery mode. FSG requests IP using bootp and tries to load zImage-recovery with tftp from bootp server.

    :   -   If you want to test OpenWrt without flashing your FSG, a
            good way is too net boot this way and to choose "ramdisk" as
            target image. Don't forget to set "mem=64M" on the command
            line in your kernel config, as it is not passed by redboot
            when booting from the network.

    -   RedBoot incorrectly reports Coyote machine ID to Linux kernel
    -   Fan is noisy. It can be slowed down using software but it causes
        higher internal temperatures.
    -   At least 250GB model came with internal Samsung 7200rpm 8MB PATA
        HDD. I don't know if other models are PATA or SATA. -- The FSG
        has the possibility to use either pata or sata disks (2 SATA and
        1 PATA connector) One SATA is always used for the external SATA
        connector. Whether PATA or SATA is used internally (and therefor
        which connector is mounted) is dependent on the
        price/performance/quality of the PATA or SATA disks at the time
        of production. The disks can come from any manufacturer, again
        depending on best price/performance/quality at the time of
        production. (rbar)
