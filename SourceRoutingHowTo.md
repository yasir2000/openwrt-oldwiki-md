source routing on OpenWrt How-To\[\[BR\]\]

the purpose of source routing:\[\[BR\]\] to decide, on basis of the
source address of packets, through which interface those packets should
leave the router.

example of its use:\[\[BR\]\] a system with multiple routes towards the
internet.\[\[BR\]\]

examples:\[\[BR\]\] 1) Two routers, each with an an adsl link and
interconnected via lan, and each serving via their shared lan or a
secondary lan a number of clients; but you want some clients to go out
through one adsl line, and other clients through the other.\[\[BR\]\] 2)
A router with two adsl connections, ppp0 and ppp1, and you want some
clients to use ppp0 , and others to use ppp1.\[\[BR\]\]

prerequisites:\[\[BR\]\] ip package (use 'ipkg install')\[\[BR\]\]

example script that should be executed upon boot; in Whiterussian place
in //etc/init.d e.g. as S80routes\_2ISPS\[\[BR\]\]

\#!/bin/sh\[\[BR\]\] \# S80routes\_2ISPS ; script for OpenWrt by
'doddel'\[\[BR\]\] \# separate traffic between two adsl connections, one
on this router ('HERE') and the other on a router\[\[BR\]\] \# that is
reached via vlan2 and has in this example ip address 192.168.2.14
('THERE')\[\[BR\]\] \# assumption is that this router talks to clients
through vlan0 (lan) and through eth1 (wifi)\[\[BR\]\] \# I normally do
not use the bridge br0 as it pollutes the scarce radio channel resource
with\[\[BR\]\] \# unnecessary traffic but this is unrelated to the
essentials of source routing.\[\[BR\]\] \# This router 'HERE'is assumed
to have following interfaces:\[\[BR\]\] \# ppp0 ; dynamical ip address,
assigned by isp\[\[BR\]\] \# vlan0 ; the lan with ip address
192.168.10.10/24\[\[BR\]\] \# vlan1 ; used by pppd to create
ppp0\[\[BR\]\] \# vlan2 ; the lan2 used to connect to the other router
that also has adsl; ip address HERE 192.168.2.10\[\[BR\]\] \# eth1 ;
wifi, with ip address 192.168.6.10, talking per radio to router
192.168.6.100 that serves clients\[\[BR\]\] \# IMPORTANT: modify
//sbin/ifup.pppoe: change 'defaultroute' option into
'nodefaultroute';\[\[BR\]\] \# when adsl gets connected the routing
settings. made by this script, do not get overwritten by pppd\[\[BR\]\]

\# the client's ip addresses\[\[BR\]\] client1\_lan="192.168.10.0/24" \#
just an example of a group of clients on 'lan'(vlan0) to be routed
equally\[\[BR\]\] client2\_wlan="192.168.12.1/32" \# just another
example of a unique client reached per radio here and needing unique
routing\[\[BR\]\] \# add the list of clients\[\[BR\]\]

\# abbreviations used filling the 'main' routing table using 'route'
commands\[\[BR\]\] HERE="netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.6.100 dev
eth1" \# define the gateway that serves the clients reached per
radio\[\[BR\]\] THERE="netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.2.14 dev vlan2"
\# define the route to the second router\[\[BR\]\]

\# define routes to subnets hidden behind routers reached via
radio\[\[BR\]\] route add -net 192.168.11.0 \${HERE} \# one subnet
reachable via eth1 and gateway 192.168.6.100\[\[BR\]\] route add -net
192.168.12.0 \${HERE} \# another subnet reachable via eth1 and gateway
192.168.6.100\[\[BR\]\] \# .... more\[\[BR\]\]

\# define routes to subnets that are reacheable via the other adsl
router\[\[BR\]\] route add -net 192.168.4.0 \${THERE} \# one subnet
reachable via vlan2 and gateway 192.168.2.14\[\[BR\]\] route add -net
192.168.57.0 \${THERE} \# one subnet reachable via vlan2 and gateway
192.168.2.14\[\[BR\]\] \# .....more\[\[BR\]\]

\# get current ip numbers of the ppp0 interface\[\[BR\]\]

\# abbreviations used filling the tables '200' '201' and '202' using 'ip
route ' commands\[\[BR\]\] \# table 200 is always checked and has all
internal routes, table 201 will be checked only for those source
addresses\[\[BR\]\] \# that should leave via THERE and contains THERE as
default route, 202 contains HERE as default route\[\[BR\]\] HERE="via
192.168.6.100 dev eth1 table 200"\[\[BR\]\] THERE="via 192.168.2.14 dev
vlan2 table 200"\[\[BR\]\] THERE202="via 192.168.2.14 dev vlan2 table
202"\[\[BR\]\]

\# populate the table \[200\] with routes equal for all (know to reach
all clients)\[\[BR\]\] ip route flush table 200\[\[BR\]\] \# the native
interfaces (are set by OS in table 'main' but need being set manually in
table \[200\])\[\[BR\]\] ip route add to \$gwyip dev ppp0 protocol

\# the routes via HERE wifi network\[\[BR\]\] ip route add to
192.168.11.0/24 \${HERE} \# clients reached via local radio\[\[BR\]\] ip
route add to 192.168.12.0/24 \${HERE} \# more clients reached via local
radio\[\[BR\]\] \# more ...\[\[BR\]\]

\# the routes via THERE wifi and/or lan network\[\[BR\]\] ip route add
to 192.168.4.0/24 \${THERE} \# clients reached via THERE\[\[BR\]\] ip
route add to 192.168.57.0/24 \${THERE} \# more clients reached via
THERE\[\[BR\]\] \# more ....\[\[BR\]\]

\# populate table \[201\], the default HERE gateway\[\[BR\]\] ip route
flush table 201\[\[BR\]\] ip route add to default via \$gwyip dev ppp0
table 201\[\[BR\]\]

\# populate table \[202\], the alternative THERE gateway\[\[BR\]\] ip
route flush table 202\[\[BR\]\] ip route add to default
\${THERE202}\[\[BR\]\]

\# now define rules for table selection, starting with highest
priority\[\[BR\]\] \# find internal destination, this table gets checked
for any source address \[200\]\[\[BR\]\] ip rule delete from 0/0
priority 50 table 200\[\[BR\]\] ip rule add from 0/0 priority 50 table
200\[\[BR\]\]

\# what comes in via HERE's lan and wifi\[\[BR\]\] \# decide what should
go out THERE and therefore should use table \[202\]\[\[BR\]\] ip rule
delete from \${client1\_lan} iif vlan0 priority 51 table 202\[\[BR\]\]
ip rule add from \${client1\_lan} iif vlan0 priority 51 table 202 \#
client1 uses THERE's adsl to reach internet\[\[BR\]\]

\# rest must go out HERE and should therefore check table
\[201\]\[\[BR\]\] ip rule delete from 0/0 priority 52 table
201\[\[BR\]\] ip rule add from 0/0 priority 52 table 201\[\[BR\]\] ip
rule delete iif lo priority 53 table 201\[\[BR\]\] ip rule add iif lo
priority 53 table 201\[\[BR\]\] ip rule delete from 127.0.0.0/8 priority
54 table 201\[\[BR\]\] ip rule add from 127.0.0.0/8 priority 54 table
201 \# anything else is HERE default\[\[BR\]\]

\# now client1's traffic will use the adsl of the other router while
client2's traffic goes out here locally.\[\[BR\]\] \# when adding more
rules make sure that the priorities are unique per client and increase
per rule (higher priority number is checked later, so the internal
destinations are always checked first, then whatever should leave THERE,
and what remains must leave HERE)\[\[BR\]\]

\# make the rules active, deleting old stuff\[\[BR\]\] ip route flush
cache \[\[BR\]\]
