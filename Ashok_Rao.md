Old timer. First unix system was a HP-PARC running HP-UX in 1991. First
linux install (redhat in 1997) followed by 3 years of intense BSD
(netBSD and freeBSD) from 1999-2001. Was waiting a long time for
something like OpenWrt which runs on cheap hardware.

Just started a small side business focusing on satellite, video and
TCP/IP consulting service primarily for Government. Check out

Planning to port some nice inverse multiplexing video software to the
Openwrt platform
