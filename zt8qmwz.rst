Hello, world! This page will contain my correspondence with
hairydairymaid (lightbulb) - I asked for his help in debricking
a TI AR7 based router. If everything goes well, hairydairymaid
will write an AR7 compatible debrick utility.

zt8qmwz, got your link and reading over the couple things I asked
about.  The CHIP ID CODE you sent ... CHIP ID: 00000000000000000001000000001111 (0000100F)
looks really fishy to me.  That *might* be real, but it is also remotely possible the
TI AR7 chip has a broken CHIP ID (there have been some chips in the past that way);
however, I would triple check the JTAG cabling and make sure it is connected correctly
for a standard 14-pin JTAG cable pinout on the board end of the cable.  In order to
write a debricker for Non-DMA capable units the EJTAG 2.5/2.6 PrAcc method will need
to be employed.  I need to work up some MIPS assembler that will run on the debug
hosted memory in the EJTAG debugging portion of the chip in order to "run" the needed reads
and writes to memory (i.e. - for flash reads/writes).  The PrAcc routines have to "feed"
in MIPS instructions over EJTAG in order for the debugging unit to actually execute
those instructions and they have to be formed in such a way as to meaningfully run code that
will read and write the desired regions.  This is not as easy as DMA access; however, it is doable.
zt8qmwz - please triple check JTAG wiring there, especially since I am doing this blind without
any equipment in front of me.  In the meantime, I'll start on the MIPS isntructions needed for
this little exercise.

hairydairymaid,

I checked the JTAG cable with a multimeter twice, and it looks like
the JTAG cable is okay. Just to confirm, here's how the JTAG cable
is wired:

{{{
Parallel Port               JTAG
-------------              -------
02 D0         <--100ohm--> 03 TDI
03 D1         <--100ohm--> 09 TCK
04 D2         <--100ohm--> 07 TMS
13 ^Select    <--100ohm--> 05 TDO

20 GND        <----+-----> 02 GND
25 GND        <----/

              /--100ohm--> 01 TRST
              \----------> 14 VIO
}}}

Are there other non-PrAcc-dependent EJTAG commands which can be used
to check the JTAG connection? For example, is it possible to learn the
amount of RAM via EJTAG? A few simple query commands should be enough
for checking the JTAG connection.

I couldn't completely understand what you are going to do. Is the
following correct? You are going to write a MIPS program which will
run in the router's memory (set aside for debugging). This program is
going to interpret the commands (which you'll devise, I guess) that
are sent over the JTAG cable. Then, the program will run the appropriate
code (flash read/write) and return the resulting data via the JTAG cable.
(I know, I am lost.)

There are some other ways to utilize basic JTAG functions to detemine to validity of the JTAG cabling; however, in the software you have there are not really those facilities.  There are no inherent JTAG commands to view the amount of RAM or anything like that.  Things are not at a high level at all.  Think of Data and Address lines and toggling those in such a fashion as to form some valid instructions to force on the bus for the processor to execute.

You are kinda on track with the interpretation of how things might work in a PrAcc type access.  What really happens is this:  

The EJTAG block (when using NON-DMA access) can initiate on-chip peripheral transfers as a SLAVE UNIT connected to the on-chip bus. The MIPS CPU can then execute code taken from the EJTAG Probe and it can access data (via load or store) which is located on the EJTAG Probe. This occurs in a serial way through the EJTAG interface: the core can thus execute instructions e.g. debug monitor code, without occupying the userâ€™s memory.

Well, since I don't have any AR7 based unit to use for this, I am writing PrAcc routines against a WRT54Gv2.0 (instead of the DMA that I already did) just as "something" to use.  I have been able to successfully get "Word Size Reads" working as expected.  I have started the "Word Size Writes" and will follow with half-word variants (needed for flash chip routines).  Let me tell you... if you thought the debrick utility was slow using parallel JTAG and EJTAG 2.0 DMA reads/writes... grab War and Peace, take a vacation, grow older, whatever!  I successfully read out the CFE bootloader area (256K) using PrAcc routines and it took about 20-25 minutes.  With DMA it is a good deal faster.  Unfortunately, many MIPS processors only support the newer EJTAG 2.5/2.6 debug units and thus no DMA support. (at least Broadcom was good for something on the bcm47xx series chips!)
