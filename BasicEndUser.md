Well, hello, Basic Enduser!

Since you are a basic enduser, the most important thing for you to
understand is that you shouldn't install the default OpenWrt load. Why?
Well, it involves all of this nasty "command-line interface" stuff that
will give you hives or at least make you very uncomfortable.

Here's the good news. You can get a lovely web interface by relying on
the fine folks at x-wrt. They repackage the default OpenWrt with all of
the crunchy web browser goodness that you expect nowadays.
\[<http://www.x-wrt.org> Read all about it\] or
\[<http://downloads.x-wrt.org/xwrt> just go get it.\]

There are those who say, "X-Wrt is too large!" Well, you judge for
yourself. Would you rather have 1.8 MB of data uploaded to your router
and have to type stuff like

{{{

:   ntpclient -c 1 -d -s -h 0.pool.ntp.org}}}

Or would you rather upload 1.9 MB and use buttons and clickable fields
to set the date and time? If you answered 1.8 MB, this is the wrong
guide for you!

If you're still here, you now need to figure out which firmware you want
(since it's very hard to upload firmware that you haven't chosen yet).
So:

> 1.  Search the Wiki with the model number of your router to determine
>     which file you need.
> 2.  Download the corresponding firmware from x-wrt rather than
>     directly from the openwrt.org site.
> 3.  Upload the firmware to the router.

Some devices, such as Buffalo routers, will not allow you to upload
third-party firmware through the web interface. In these cases, you may
wish to invite a geeky friend over who understands arcane mumbo-jumbo
like default IP addressing schemes and can do magical things like TFTP.
However, if you can use the web interface on your router (such as
Cisco's Linksys --
\[<http://splashofstyle.com/archives/2007/04/13/configuring-linksys-router/>
here is a good example\]), you will likely be in good shape to upload
the firmware on your own.

Good luck!
