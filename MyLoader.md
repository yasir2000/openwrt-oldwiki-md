== MyLoader == MyLoader is the bootloader only seen so far on Compex
wireless routers. If you have seen this bootloader on other devices that
you own please add them to the bottom of the page. Unlike CFE or
Redboot, MyLoader is a menu driven bootloader like the standard one on
all adm5120 platforms by Edimax, Sweex and others. There are more
details on the standard bootloader available on the midge website:
<http://midge.vlad.org.ua>

The following data is for COMPEX WP54AG (non WRT version) and is
probably valid also for COMPEX NP27G:

Images used for updating firmware consist of update header(offset 0) and
system image(size+crc32+gziped kernel+cramfs; offset 0x100f8). After
verifying update header, system image is saved to the first mtd
partition (mtd1, memory address: 0x1fc00000). When booting, MyLoader
verifies(crc) flash stored image, ungzips it and runs kernel....

firmware update image description:

{{{ address: size description --------update
header----------------------0x00000: 4B MAGIC (004d594c) 0x00004: 4B
CRC?? (unknown checksum, can be disabled by setting to 00000000)
0x00010: 8B 2xDEVICE ID 0x00050: 4B size of system image (from 0x100f8)
-------system image------------------------0x100f8: 4B size of gzipped
kernel+cramfs 0x100fc: 4B crc32 of gzipped kernel+cramfs (from 0x10100
to eof) 0x10100: n/a gziped linux kernel + cramfs filesystem }}}

(note: there is a lot of another data in update header, but you have to
modify only size (0x50) and disable checksum (0x4) to load modified
system image)

Below is a set of instructions which can be used to update the
bootloader to CFE using the bundle provided for the WP54-WRT. I have
tried this on my WP54G-1D but after a few seconds the board freezes
(EDIT: this is probably because CFE for WP54-WRT checks for "security
device" attached to GPIO0, GPIO1 and will not run on non WRT versions of
WP54). Also JTAG seems to be a bit odd on these boxes, and as yet I have
to get some sensible looking results from it.
