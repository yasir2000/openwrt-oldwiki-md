As of January 2008, active work is under way to get OpenWRT running well on these routers.  AR9132 400Mhz MIPS CPU seems to be on all models, u-boot is the most frequent bootloader, all seem to have 32MB of RAM and at least 4MB of FLASH. The CPU is typically paired with the AR9102 (2x2 MIMO), or AR9103 (3x3 MIMO) radio chip. Check the Kamikaze forums for latest information.

== AP81 Routers ==

 * Trendnet TEW-632BRP, AP81-AR9130-RT-070614-00, ar9102 2x2 MIMO
 * Trendnet TEW-652BRP, AP81-AR9130-RT-080609-05, ar9102 2x2 MIMO
 * D-Link DIR-615 revision C1, AP81-AR9130-RT-080609-05, ar9102 2x2 MIMO
 * Netgear WNR2000, unknown hardware ID, ar9103 3x3 MIMO
 * TP-Link TL-WR941N or TL-WR941ND, unknown hardware ID, ar9103 3x3 MIMO, details: http://network.pconline.com.cn/pingce/0803/1252528_5.html
 * Planex mzk-w300nh, unknown hardware ID, ar9102 2x2 MIMO
 * Netgear WN802T version 2, suggested on this page http://blog.chinaunix.net/u2/83623/showart_1353786.html
 * Planex MZK-W04NU, ar9103 3x3 MIMO, 1 USB port included - and believed to have 8MB of FLASH based on firmware download size
 * Atlantiland A02-RB-W300N
 * Cameo Communications WLN2206, FCC id same as Trendnet TEW-632BRP according to SmallNetBuilder website
 * Mercury MWR300T+, ar9103 3x3 MIMO, details: http://bbs.whbear.com/thread-62276-1-1.html - probably a clone of the TL-WR941ND, because it uses the same firmware.
 * Zyxel model NBG-420N
 * Zyxel models NBG-460N, X550N, X550NH, 401764. They run ZyOS (not Linux) but the bootloader seems flexible.  Info: http://en.network01.net/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=15&forum=2

== AP83 Routers ==

 * Unex RNRA-83, http://www.unex.com.tw/spec/rnra-83
 * Unex RNEA-81: AP83 AR9130+AR9104
 * ARADA SoC Econo Series 2
 * Linksys WAP-4410N, if you read the release notes for the firmware on this router you will clearly see AP83 reference.
