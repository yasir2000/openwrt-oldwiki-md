This package seems to be broken.

Portmap is not working, and nobody to fix it yet. Seems that NFS on
kamikaze is not going to work.

= Intro = Here's how I was able to export a USB drive from my WRTSL54GS.

= Requirements = Get the drive mounted (see: UsbStorageHowto)

= Installation = Install NFS kernel module and server:

{{{ ipkg update ipkg install kmod-nfs nfs-server }}}

Load kernel modules (sunrpc lockd nfs): {{{ insmod sunrpc insmod lockd
insmod nfs }}} ...or reboot to pick up all the kernel module deps that
nfs has.

= Configuration =

> -   edit your /etc/exports appropriately (mine is just ''/mnt/disc0\_2
>     client.ip.addr(rw,no\_root\_squash,async)'')

Start RPC: {{{ /etc/init.d/S59portmap start }}}

Start NFS: {{{ /etc/init.d/S60nfsd start }}}

At this point, I would try to mount the NFS drive and get "Stale NFS
mount" errors. Here's what I did to get around it:

> -   I killed rpc.nfsd
> -   I restarted it like so: ''/usr/sbin/rpc.nfsd -R /mnt/disc0\_2''
