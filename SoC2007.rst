== Complete AR7Port ==

Take a step forward on [:AR7Port] by booting a linux kernel on [:OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/ZyXEL/Prestige_660HW-61]. The findings on this platform will be useful for other AR7-based router brands.

Most work around this device has been done using [http://www.ixo.de/info/zyxel_uclinux/ uCLinux], but now it's time to get OpenWRT working on it and get its main hardware components
supported:

 * Filesystem mountpoints (flash map)
 * ADSL
 * ACX100 WIFI

In addition, firmware flashing scripts are needed for this router series: CRC signatures used by the device's web firmware flasher have already been identified. These scripts will avoid the
need to build a cable to flash the firmware.

Again, all these findings should be useful for several [http://wiki.openwrt.org/CategoryAR7Device other brands using the same chip], not just for this particular device.

Skills required: 
 * Basic electronics (needed to build a serial cable with a TTL level inverter)
 * Knowledge about MIPS architecture
 * Good level at C and MIPS assembly
