/!'''WARNING LOADING AN UNOFFICIAL FIRMWARE WILL VOID YOUR WARRANTY'''
/!
 = Introduction = This guide is intended for beginners to Linux and/or
!OpenWrt. This guide is dedicated for updating !OpenWrt on the !LinkSys
WRT54GL router and the experiences gained by it. This information is
specific to the WRT54GL, however, it can be applied to all routers that
are compatible with OpenWrt. For information on installing !OpenWrt
please visit InstallingWrt54gl. This article assumes you have installed
OpenWrt before as there would be no other need to update.

/!'''Reflashing with OpenWrt WILL RESET THE FILESYSTEM''' /!
 = Updating OpenWrt = You may wish to reflash the WRT54GL or router of
your choice for any number of reasons. It can be done two different ways
such as through the web interface or using tftp (or atftp).

=== Updating using Router Web Interface === To update !Open Wrt using
the router's web interface simply access the web interface page at
192.168.1.1.

If you have problems accessing the web interface page first try clearing
your browser cache. If that doesn't work it may be possible that your
version of !OpenWrt does not support the web interface or it may not be
available for other reasons. If you cannot access the web interface page
please use the next updating method. If you can access the web interface
page continue with this section.

Then go to system - &gt; administration - &gt; firmware upgrade. Locate
the !OpenWrt Firmware Image file and that's it. Be sure that the power
supply is stable and not disconnected during transfer. After your
installation depending on the type of !OpenWrt you chose you may need to
restart you router. Many people have reported inconsistent results.
RussNelson notes that v4.30.0 gave the "Upgrade are failed!" error, but
upgrading to Linksys.com's v4.30.5 reflashed OpenWRT just fine.

=== Updating using tftp === Before updating your WRT54GL using tftp you
need to make sure BOOT\_WAIT option is on.

==== Turn BOOT\_WAIT ON ==== By default, boot\_wait is "off" on the
WRT54GL routers, in fact, most routers have boot\_wait "off" by default.
Turning boot\_wait "on" simply increases the time it takes to boot.
Turning Boot\_wait "on" increases that window of opportunity and makes
it easier to catch and install OpenWrt. Apparently, on some routers you
can install older firmware that enables a ping exploit where commands
can be typed directly into the routers Web Interface to turn Boot\_wait
"on" or "off". This does not work with WRT54GL so do not try to roll
back the firmware, it is not recommended. In fact, turning Boot\_wait
"on" for installing OpenWrt on the WRT54GL using tftp is not necessary
(but it helps).

There atleast three different ways to turn BOOT\_WAIT ON.

1.  Easiest - Access the web interface on the WRT54GL and turn the
    BOOT\_WAIT option on. You should actually do this immediately after
    installing !OpenWrt for the first time.
2.  Moderate - You can telnet into your router by typing "telnet
    192.168.1.1" which allows you access to the console. At this point
    type "nvram get BOOT\_WAIT" into the console. It will reply telling
    you yes or no. If it says "yes" you are fine, leave it alone. If it
    says "no" type "nvram set BOOT\_WAIT=on". To confirm, type "nvram
    get BOOT\_WAIT=on" and verify that it says "yes". Afterwards, you
    need to commit it to memory. Type "nvram commit". And that's it.
    BOOT\_WAIT is on!
3.  Hard - The only reason this is hard is because the WRT54GL does not
    have a standard serial port ready to connect to. You need to modify
    your board in order to install one. For more information on
    installing a serial port to your WRT54GL check out this page
    SerialPortWrt54gl. If you have one connected simply plug it into the
    serial port of another PC (Linux or Windows) and open a
    hyperterminal. Connect at 115200,8,N,1 and then turn on your router.
    You'll notice that the everything gets dumped to the terminal (as
    the router boots you should see this) including information prior to
    !OpenWrt loading. Once you get access to the console follow the
    steps above in the Moderate section for connecting using telnet.
    It's the same method.

Boot\_wait console information can also be obtained from
<http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/BootWait?highlight=%28bootwait%29>.

==== tftp Transfer ==== The reason tftp is useful is because overall it
is fast, it can all be done on the command line.

tftp is mainly recommended for those looking to install their own self
compiled images of !OpenWrt, because it can also be used to recover from
a problem and allow you to put on another Firmware Image, whether it is
!OpenWrt or the original from !LinkSys. This is only relevant in the
event that something happens to the router, the install was interrupted
or the code causes the router to crash. You can then use tftp to reflash
the router with another firmware. If something happens to you router the
Web Interface may not be available to you. This is where tftp shines!

atftp is the same as tftp except it's supposedly an advanced version.

Updating !OpenWrt is the same as installing !OpenWrt.

This is the process I use when updating !OpenWrt. I use a self-compiled
image called JFFS2 because I want to be able to write to the system. Set
everything up so that you can telnet (or ssh) into the router. Make the
connections but do not turn your router on.

On another PC with Linux open a terminal and type the following command:

atftp --trace --option "timeout 1" --option "mode octet" --put
--local-file openwrt-xxx-x.x-xxx.bin 192.168.1.1 (where the x's are you
version)

Then hit enter. (keep your router off during this)

Now hit control-C to cancel.

Now turn on your router.

Now type "telnet 192.168.1.1" (if it doesn't connect the first time you
may have tried connecting to early, simply try again)

When you are connected you should be in the !OpenWrt console, type
"reboot".

At this point you are back in the linux terminal, hit the up arrow twice
to bring the "atftp ..." command back on the screen. Hit enter.

It is important to understand that immediately after you reboot the
router from with !OpenWrt you need to run the "atftp ..." command from
above. Timing is everything at this point. You have to be quick. If you
take too long you will miss the window (that BOOT\_WAIT gives you). And
it's easier to miss than you think. This is why I make sure to keep the
"atftp ..." command in memory. It makes it easier and quicker to bring
up. You could very easily just have it ready in another terminal. What
ever your preference, the idea is that you have to be quick and in order
to be quick you need to have the "atftp ..." command previously typed.

You know you made it in time when you see your PC transfer over the
image in 512 byte blocks and there could be a lot of them depending on
the size of your image. Wait for it to finish before doing anything
else. And make sure the power does not get disconnected.

Depending on which version of !OpenWrt you use you may have an extra
reboot step. You should wait around 60 seconds after the transfer is
complete. Depending on which version of !OpenWrt you use it may reboot
itself or you may have to power it down and power it back up (basically,
turn it off and on). Afterwards, telnet into it again and you're in your
updated !OpenWrt.
