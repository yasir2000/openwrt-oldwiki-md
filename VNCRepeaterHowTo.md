'''VNC Repeater howto'''

\[\[TableOfContents\]\] = Introduction = I'm sure many of you are
asking, "What is a VNC Repeater?" Well, say you have 2 computers in your
house, and you want to be able to connect to both of them from the
internet. You would have to forward 2 ports (not including the viewer
applet which adds another port each) the default port for this is 5900.
Well, what a VNC Repeater does, is you forward one port to it, and when
it recieves a viewer connection, it then forwards the port to the
appropriate vnc server. Thus, you can have many computers behind a NAT
router and only have to forward one port.

Full documentation on the repeater is available at
\[<http://www.uvnc.com/addons/repeater.html> ultravnc\]

= Installation = Configure your device to use the backports repository,
see \["OpenWrtDocs/Packages"\] for instructions, then install the
package:

{{{ ipkg install vncrepeater }}}

You may want to check if a new version is available
\[<http://www.rit.edu/~reh5586/openwrt/packages/vncrepeater/> here\]

Edit: This is only a temporary thing... my linux box is down, so I can't
send package updates to the dev team. Thus, the vncrepeater in the
backports is an old version. Go
\[<http://www.rit.edu/~reh5586/openwrt/packages/vncrepeater/> here\] for
the latest version. (if you are on the dev team, I can tell u what to
change, but I can't do a subversion diff (it's not a big change)
(<eatnubmer1@gmail.com>).

Also, the package setup in trunk is wrong for compiling. If you want to
compile that, the URL of the tar.gz file is
\[<http://www.rit.edu/~reh5586/openwrt/packages/vncrepeater/0.12-1/src/vncrepeater-0.12.tar.gz>
this\]

= Configuration = Configuration is pretty straightforward, The file
/etc/vncrepeater.conf is the config file. (please note that I know about
the \^M charachters you see when editing the file in vim. You can either
remove them or leave them as is. They will not appear in the next
version.)

The config file is as follows:

{{{ \[general\] ;Ports viewerport = 5800 serverport = 5900

;Listen Ip address (of repeater itself) in case your server happens to
have several ;ip addresses (for example, one physical machine running
several virtual ;machines each having their own ip address) ;default

repeater versions (before 0.12) did ;Notice ! This IS NOT address of
server or viewer, but repeater itself ! listeneripaddress = 0.0.0.0

;How many sessions can we have active at the same time ? ;values can be
\[1...1000\] ;Notice: If you actually *have* computer(s) capable ;of
1000 simultaneous sessions, you are probably a *very big company*, ;so
please invite me to visit and admire your server(s) ;-) maxsessions =

;If program is started as root (to allow binding ports below 1024), ;it

create a suitable (normal, non-privileged) user/group and change name

;Allowed modes for repeater ;0=None, 1=Only Mode 1, 2=Only Mode 2,
3=Both modes ;Notice: If you set allowedmodes = 0, repeater will run
without listening to any ports, ;it will just wait for your ctlr + c ;-)

}}}

Everything is pretty straightforward, the one thing you may want to take
note of are the lines: viewerport = 5800 serverport = 5900 The
viewerport is the port on the wan side which your viewer will connect
to. The serverport is the port on the lan side which the repeater will
connect to the server on.

= Usage = NOTE: This is INCOMPATIBLE with the Java based viewer. You
MUST use a vnc viewer that supports proxy servers in order to use this
repeater.

In order to use the repeater, (as I said above) your viewer must support
a proxy server. A great viewer I suggest is the standalone viewer
available from \[<http://ultravnc.sourceforge.net/> ultravnc\]: Get it
\[<http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/ultravnc/UltraVnc-Viewer-101.zip?download>
here\]. The proxy server will be configured to be your wan address
(Dyndns is good for this) and the port the repeater is running on (ex.
home.dyndns.org:5800). The server address is the LOCAL address of the
computer you want to connect to (ex. 192.168.1.2).

That's it!

= Notes = I hope you find the repeater useful, i decided to port it to
the !OpenWrt cuz i have been working to get rid of my server and replace
it with my router. (many thanks to [florian]() for helping to get it to
compile) If you have any comments/suggestions, you can reach me at the
