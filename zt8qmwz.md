Hello, world! This page will contain my correspondence with
hairydairymaid (lightbulb) - I asked for his help in debricking a TI AR7
based router. If everything goes well, hairydairymaid will write an AR7
compatible debrick utility.

  zt8qmwz, got your link and reading over the couple things I asked
  about. The CHIP ID CODE you sent ... CHIP ID: 00000000000000000001000000001111 (0000100F)
  looks really fishy to me. That *might* be real, but it is also remotely possible the
  TI AR7 chip has a broken CHIP ID (there have been some chips in the past that way);
  however, I would triple check the JTAG cabling and make sure it is connected correctly
  for a standard 14-pin JTAG cable pinout on the board end of the cable. In order to
  write a debricker for Non-DMA capable units the EJTAG 2.5/2.6 PrAcc method will need
  to be employed. I need to work up some MIPS assembler that will run on the debug
  hosted memory in the EJTAG debugging portion of the chip in order to "run" the needed reads
  and writes to memory (i.e. - for flash reads/writes). The PrAcc routines have to "feed"
  in MIPS instructions over EJTAG in order for the debugging unit to actually execute
  those instructions and they have to be formed in such a way as to meaningfully run code that
  will read and write the desired regions. This is not as easy as DMA access; however, it is doable.
  zt8qmwz - please triple check JTAG wiring there, especially since I am doing this blind without
  any equipment in front of me. In the meantime, I'll start on the MIPS instructions needed for
  this little exercise.

  hairydairymaid,
  I checked the JTAG cable with a multimeter twice, and it looks like
  the JTAG cable is okay. Just to confirm, here's how the JTAG cable
  is wired:
  {{{
  Parallel Port JTAG
  ------------- -------
  02 D0 &lt;--100ohm--&gt; 03 TDI
  03 D1 &lt;--100ohm--&gt; 09 TCK
  04 D2 &lt;--100ohm--&gt; 07 TMS
  13 \^Select &lt;--100ohm--&gt; 05 TDO
  20 GND &lt;----+-----&gt; 02 GND
  25 GND &lt;----/
  /--100ohm--&gt; 01 TRST
  ----------&gt; 14 VIO
  }}}
  Are there other non-PrAcc-dependent EJTAG commands which can be used
  to check the JTAG connection? For example, is it possible to learn the
  amount of RAM via EJTAG? A few simple query commands should be enough
  for checking the JTAG connection.
  I couldn't completely understand what you are going to do. Is the
  following correct? You are going to write a MIPS program which will
  run in the router's memory (set aside for debugging). This program is
  going to interpret the commands (which you'll devise, I guess) that
  are sent over the JTAG cable. Then, the program will run the appropriate
  code (flash read/write) and return the resulting data via the JTAG cable.
  (I know, I am lost.)

  There are some other ways to utilize basic JTAG functions to detemine to validity of the JTAG cabling; however, in the software you have there are not really those facilities. There are no inherent JTAG commands to view the amount of RAM or anything like that. Things are not at a high level at all. Think of Data and Address lines and toggling those in such a fashion as to form some valid instructions to force on the bus for the processor to execute.
  You are kinda on track with the interpretation of how things might work in a PrAcc type access. What really happens is this:
  The EJTAG block (when using NON-DMA access) can initiate on-chip peripheral transfers as a SLAVE UNIT connected to the on-chip bus. The MIPS CPU can then execute code taken from the EJTAG Probe and it can access data (via load or store) which is located on the EJTAG Probe. This occurs in a serial way through the EJTAG interface: the core can thus execute instructions e.g. debug monitor code, without occupying the user's memory.
  Well, since I don't have any AR7 based unit to use for this, I am writing PrAcc routines against a WRT54Gv2.0 (instead of the DMA that I already did) just as "something" to use. I have been able to successfully get "Word Size Reads" working as expected. I have started the "Word Size Writes" and will follow with half-word variants (needed for flash chip routines). Let me tell you... if you thought the debrick utility was slow using parallel JTAG and EJTAG 2.0 DMA reads/writes... grab War and Peace, take a vacation, grow older, whatever! I successfully read out the CFE bootloader area (256K) using PrAcc routines and it took about 20-25 minutes. With DMA it is a good deal faster. Unfortunately, many MIPS processors only support the newer EJTAG 2.5/2.6 debug units and thus no DMA support. (at least Broadcom was good for something on the bcm47xx series chips!)

  hairydairymaid,
  I have written a simple patch for the debrick utility version 4.1.
  With this patch, the EJTAG features that are implemented in the processor are printed.
  You probably know about IMPCODE. (If not, it is explained in the EJTAG 2.6 specification document by MIPS.)
  The bad news is that all zeroes are printed for my board.
  Can you let me know what gets printed for your (Linksys) board after you apply this patch?
  Here's the patch...

  Oh, and by the way, (as I mentioned in the patch,) it looks like DMA is coming back
  as an optional feature in future EJTAG versions. And regarding the difference of
  speed between PrAcc and DMA methods, my guess is that most people would probably
  prefer *some* (even slow) way of recovering bricked routers (based on recent MIPS
  processors) rather than dumping them in the garbage. No matter how slow PrAcc routines
  are, it is nice to hear good news from your side.

  It sure appears your JTAG cabling needs a little adjustment somewhere. I suspected the ID CODE of 0x100f looked very fishy. It seems at the moment that is not talking properly. I'll look at the mappings for you in a bit.
  On another note... the code you provided is close and I did cut and paste into my program here for comparison. The only thing I changed was the part below:
  {{{
  // EJTAG DMA Support
  tmp = features & (1u &lt;&lt; 14);
  printf(" EJTAG DMA Support: ");
  if (tmp == 0)
  //printf("Unknown (%d is a reserved value)n", tmp);
  printf("Yesn", tmp);
  else
  printf("Non");
  }}}
  Since bit 14 of the IMPLEMENTATION register denoted DMA support (0 = yes)(1 = no). In the 2.5 and 2.6 standards they just call it "reserved" (since they don't implement DMA in those versions). I have a much more detailed routine that does that which is helpful, but not needed when things are really working. Now that PrAcc routines might be in there - I'll use the "DMA Support" bit as the driver.
  Here are the results I get against a Linksys WRT54Gv2.0 board:

As you can see it does indeed get the proper data... which is another
indicator we need to get your JTAG cabling correct. It may be some
needed pullups or pulldowns be in place or removed. Or it could be just
crossed lines. Or it could be solder not making good contact. That is
what we need to focus on at the moment.

I have added all the PrAcc rotuines for word and half word reads and
writes. I can fully read and write to Intel flash chips here using PrAcc
routines. I still need to add a little code for the AMD and SST style
flash chips. This is needed since the DMA effectively use byte lanes
when the sending the flash commands and PrAcc routines need to be ever
so slightly different. Also need to do some code cleanup. I have hand
tweaked some of the MIPS assembly instructions to reduce the number
needed to be sent to a minimum and that has helped speedwise of the
PrAcc routines; however they are still slower than DMA routines (to be
expected).

If you can focus on getting your JTAG cable working and reading what
looks like a valid CHIP ID CODE that will be a big help. In trying - try
adjusting the instruction\_length variable from say a length 3 up thru
10 (valid ranges are really 5 to 8 if I recall), and recompile and try
each value checking the CHIP ID CODE for something useful.

hairydairymaid,

I have good news! I followed your advice and tried instruction lengths
other than 8 bits. And guess what, this router (or TI AR7, rather) uses
an instruction length of 5! I have no idea why the chip ID reads
succeeded before... It was probably because of the detection code for
BCM4702 Chip which also uses an instruction length of 5.

Here is the output of the hacked wrt54g: (Edit: I mean the debrick
program, not the router!)

Hi, All!

Try this links: \[<http://www.dlinkpedia.net/index.php/Jtag_su_30xT>
JTAG for D-Link DSL-30xT\],
\[<http://www.dlinkpedia.net/index.php/Interfaccia_JTAG> JTAGInterface\]
(Italian, but I hope you cold understand at least some words).

The '''OCD Debugger''' works ans '''OCD Flash''' works too. BUT! You
need a full WIGGLER cable, instead of your favorite "Xilix DLC parallel
cable III" mage with 5 resistors... ;)

I've tested it with ADM5120 CPU (another MIPS with EJTAG 2.6) and found
it working, even single Step debug works. My expiriments are descibed
there: <http://www.norocketscience.com/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=67> You
could find my WIGGLER schematic variant there too.

I hope it helps. I have an AR7 router too and will test it ASAP.

'''hairydairymaid''' (time of last update:

The PrAcc programing for the debrick utility has been done for a while
and is working as expected. All operations are working as expected on
the test boards I have here... which, unfortunately, none are TI AR7
based boards... so we'll need some testing done elsewhere.

zt8qmwz, I have sent you a version to test out for me and we'll see how
that goes. If all goes well then I'll probably be set to go ahead
release a new version of the debrick utility very shortly.

Cheers, -hairydairymaid
