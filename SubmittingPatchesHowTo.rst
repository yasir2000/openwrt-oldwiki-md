= How To Submit Patches to OpenWrt =
OpenWrt is constantly being improved.  We'd like as many people to contribute to this as we can get. If you find a change useful, by all means try to get it incorporated into the project. This should improve OpenWrt and it should help carry your changes forward into future versions

This document tries to lay out a procedure to enable people to submit patches in a way that is most effective for all concerned.

It is important to do all these steps repeatedly:

 * '''listen''' to what other people think
 * '''talk''' explaining what problem you are addressing and your proposed solution
 * '''do''' write useful patches including documentation
 * '''test test test'''
== where to listen and talk ==
 * google to find things related to your problem
 * wiki: check this wiki [OpenWrtDocs]
 * [http://lists.openwrt.org/ Mailing Lists]
 * [http://forum.openwrt.org/ forums]
 * IRC irc.freenode.net, channels #openwrt and #openwrt-devel
 * TRAC https://dev.openwrt.org/ the issue/bug/change tracking system
== Documentation ==
It is often best to document what you are doing before you do it.  The process of documentation often exposes possible improvements.  Keep your documentation up to date.

== Patch Submission Process ==
 1. Use git or svn to create a patch. Creating patches manually with diff -urN also works, but is usually unnecessary.
 1. Send a mail to openwrt-devel <at> lists.openwrt.org with the following contents:
  1. [PATCH] <short description> in the Subject, followed by:
  1. (optional) a longer description of your patch in the message body
  1. Signed-off-by: Your name <your@email.address>
  1. Your actual patch, inline, not word wrapped or whitespace mangled. 
 1. Please read [http://kerneltrap.org/Linux/Email_Clients_and_Patches] to find out how to make sure your email client doesn't destroy your patch.
 1. Please use your real name and email address in the Signed-off-by line, following the same guidelines as in [http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=blob;f=Documentation/SubmittingPatches;h=681e2b36195c98ea5271b76383b3a574b190b04f;hb=HEAD Linux Kernel patch submission guidelines]
