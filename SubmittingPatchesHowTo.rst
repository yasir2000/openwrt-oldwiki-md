= How To Submit Patches to OpenWRT =

OpenWRT is constantly being improved.  We'd like as many people to contribute to this as we can get.

If you find a change useful, by all means try to get it incorporated into the project.  This should improve OpenWRT and it should help carry your changes forward into future versions of OpenWRT

This document tries to lay out a procedure to enable people to submit patches in a way that is most effective for all concerned.

It is important to do all these steps repeatedly:
 * '''listen''' to what other people think
 * '''talk''' explaining what problem you are addressing and your proposed solution
 * '''do''' write useful patches including documentation
 * '''test test test'''

== where to listen and talk ==

 * google to find things related to your problem
 * wiki: check this wiki [OpenWrtDocs]
 * [http://lists.openwrt.org/ Mailing Lists]
 * [http://forum.openwrt.org/ forums]
 * IRC irc.freenode.net, channels #openwrt and #openwrt-devel
 * TRAC [https://dev.openwrt.org/] the issue/bug/change tracking system

== documentation ==

It is best to document what you are doing before you do it.  The process of documentation often exposes possible improvements.  Keep your documentation up to date.

== submission process ==

 1. Use git or svn to create a patch+
 2. Send a mail with [PATCH] <title> in the subject, and optionally further description in the message body to the openwrt-devel mailing list
 3. Then a Signed-off-by: Name <email> line, and the rest of the patch inline with no word wrapping and fix whitespace issues, CFLAGS etc..

I don't actually know how you get someone to sign off on a patch.

I don't know who the senior project members are and what their privileges and responsibilities are.
 * who make sure that posted patches are dealt with
 * who make sure TRAC entries are dealt with
 * who is supposed to check on the quality and usefulness of patches
