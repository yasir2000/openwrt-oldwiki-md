Notes:

> -   Just because a device is in this list doesn't mean that OpenWRT
>     will run on this device. Furthermore, some devices have limited
>     support, while others get by with just the bare minimums. For
>     example. Devices with 2mb of flash and 8mb of ram will be able to
>     handle basic tasks only.
