= Running Kamikaze images under qemu =

The Kamikaze x86 images run directly under qemu; all you need to do is
to grow them to the full size that the partition table defines. This
will be roughly 20MB, since the default configuration is 4MB for the
boot partition and 16MB for the data partition, but will be a bit larger
than this due to rounding up to whole numbers of cylinders.

Work out the exact number of sectors that the image should be by looking
at the partition table, and multiplying the highest cylinder number by
the sectors per cylinder:

{{{ \$ fdisk openwrt-x86-2.6-jffs2-128k.image You must set cylinders.
You can do this from the extra functions menu.

Command (m for help): p

Now you can boot this image directly:

{{{ \$ sudo apt-get install qemu \# for Ubuntu \$ qemu
openwrt-x86-2.6-jffs2-128k.image }}}

Type 'qemu' by itself to get a list of options. Useful ones are
'-snapshot' which keeps your image pristine (writes are made to
temporary files); '-k en-gb' to set the keyboard layout; and '-m 64' to
set the available memory to 64MB (defaults to 128MB)

Inside the VGA window, use Ctrl-Alt to release the mouse, and
Ctrl-Alt-1/2/3 to switch between guest VGA, qemu monitor (where you can
manage qemu itself), and serial port.

The '-nographic' option disables the VGA window display entirely and
redirects the serial console to stdin/stdout. There are some special key
sequences here for getting access to the monitor - type Ctrl-a h for
help on these.

= Networking =

Network access to your image is provided by a virtual NE2000-type
network card in the emulated guest environment. To access this you will
need the ''kmod-ne2k-pci'' package, which is included by default in the
x86 image.

== User-mode networking ==

"User-mode" networking is enabled by default. Within the guest, if you
edit /etc/config/network, set "option proto dhcp", then run "ifup lan",
the br-lan interface will pick up an IP address from an internal private
network, 10.0.2.x.

It then has outbound access to the Internet via your host machine, which
appears to be a NAT firewall. You won't be able to send an ICMP ping
(qemu would need to run as root to provide that), but you can open TCP
connections and perform DNS lookups. For example, "ipkg update" works as
expected.

No root privileges are needed to run qemu this way. However, if you wish
to allow incoming connections then this has to be done via port
forwarding (see the -redir option), just like on a real NAT firewall.

== Bridged networking ==

A more powerful solution is to bridge your host adaptor's ethernet
directly with the virtual ethernet NIC(s) of your QEMU guest(s). This
gives them full access to your LAN as peers, and can pick up their own
IP addresses using your LAN's existing DHCP server.

To do this involves setting up software bridging on the host, and adding
the 'tap' device to this same bridge. The following instructions are for
Ubuntu Linux.

Install the 'bridge-utils' package to get the '''brctl''' utility.

Now, you need to link your host PC's network port into a software
bridge. Let's say your existing 'outside' Internet connection is via
eth1, and you wish to bridge QEMU guests onto this. Firstly, unconfigure
your network using '''ifdown eth1'''. Now edit /etc/network/interfaces
and change {{{ auto eth1 iface eth1 inet dhcp }}} to {{{ auto br1 iface
br1 inet dhcp bridge\_ports eth1 }}}

Finally bring the interface back up using '''ifup br1'''. From now on,
your outside connection is via br1, which is linked to eth1. Use
'''brctl show''' to see this.

Next you need to edit '''/etc/qemu-ifup''', which is the script run by
qemu when it needs to access the interface, so that it can add itself
into the bridge.

{{{ \#!/bin/sh sudo -p "Password for \$0:" /sbin/ifconfig \$1 0.0.0.0
promisc up sudo /usr/sbin/brctl addif br1 \$1 }}}

Finally, start qemu like this:

{{{ qemu -net tap -net nic -hda openwrt-x86-2.6-squashfs.image }}}

What happens is that qemu creates a new 'tap' interface, e.g. tap0,
connects this to the virtual NIC within the guest environment, and the
qemu-ifup script connects this to the software bridge in the host
environment.

If you get the following permission error: {{{ warning: could not open
/dev/net/tun: no virtual network emulation Could not initialize device
'tap' }}}

then you can chown /dev/net/tun to your own userid, or else run qemu as
root.

If you are running multiple qemu instances simultaneously then each one
will need to have a unique MAC address assigned to it: e.g.

{{{ qemu -net tap -net nic,macaddr=52:54:0:0:0:1 -hda
openwrt-x86-2.6-squashfs.image1 qemu -net tap -net
nic,macaddr=52:54:0:0:0:2 -hda openwrt-x86-2.6-squashfs.image2 ... }}}

Conversely, it's possible to connect a single qemu instance to multiple
software bridges (and hence external NICs) on the host. This can be done
by using a separate qemu-ifup script for each one, linking to a separate
software bridge instance.

{{{ qemu -net nic,vlan=1 -net nic,vlan=2
 -net tap,vlan=1,script=/etc/qemu-ifup -net
tap,vlan=2,script=/etc/qemu-ifup2
 -hda openwrt-x86-2.6-squashfs.image }}}

Now within the guest, eth0 connects to one bridge and eth1 connects to
another.

== Other options ==

There are many other qemu networking possibilities, such as setting up
IP-over-TCP encapsulation for point-to-point links between qemus, or
IP-over-UDP multicast. Read the qemu manpage or google for other
examples, e.g. <http://www.gnome.org/~markmc/qemu-networking.html> and
<http://www.h7.dion.ne.jp/~qemu-win/HowToNetwork-en.html>
