Real world examples.

I created this page to contribute to this project by step by step
describing Open WRT instalations running in real word. I created those
instalations mostly to implement advanced router features. My intention
is to provide step by step log of commands and settings necessary to
achieve certain configuration.

== Multi subnet small IT company router == === Router requested features
=== This is the very first advanced configuration with Open WRT I want
to describe. The requirements were as follow: 1. The embeded device
shall provide Internet access to all conected computers with different
policy for some groups of users. 2. The embeded device will replace the
existing routing capabilities of Linux server. I do not want to route
via Linux server anymore as it has many many other things to do and is
under haavy reconfiguration process. 3. List of features on embeded
devices: \* service MORE than one separate LAN conected to embeded
device \* slave DNS server (to existing Linux server) \* PPTP server
(take this feature from Linux server) \* QoS 4.

==== Network topology ==== The ISP provides a DLS connection terminated
by SpeedStream modem. We are provided with 5 usable IP addresses (Mask
of 255.255.255.248): \* 80.55.248.80 - net address \* 80.55.248.81 -
ADSL modem IP address \* 80.55.248.82 - free \* 80.55.248.83 - free (we
will install our OpenWRT router here) \* 80.55.248.84 - free \*
80.55.248.85 - Linux company server \* 80.55.248.86 - free \*
80.55.248.87 - broadcast address

We need a dew private subnets with different routing and QoS features:

:   -   10.112.170.x / 24 as a primary LAN network for main office.
    -   10.216.208.x / 24 as a VPN acccesible via PPTP protocol.
    -   10.98.226.x / 24 as a WiFi subnet primary for mobile
        laptops/guests
    -   10.90.201.x / 24 as a separate from above LAN subnet for purpose
        of wiring hotel placed above main office.

=== Implementation === ==== Hardware and firmware upgrade ==== I decided
to purchase Linksys WRT54GL v 1.1 model. Its serial number is
CL7B1FB39805. The first step was replace vendor firmware with OpenWRT.
It is very trivial task. You had to download a firmware from
\[\[<http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/newest/default/>\]\]. In
my case it was file named openwrt-wrt54g-squashfs.bin. Before flashing
your device I strongly recommend to compare MD5SUMs of downloaded file
to those avaiable at download pages. I used vendor firmware for
upgrading the firmware. After flashing, the device will boot. Please
then use telnet (not ssh as it will not work) to log into your embeded
device and set root password. Setting root password allows you to log in
via SSH. The command to issue are:

{{{ telnet 192.168.1.1 (from your PC of course, log in as root with
empty password) passwd (after it you type and re-type your root
password) reboot (to restart device) }}}

At this point you should be able to ssh to your router and be able to
enjoy embeded linux. I also decided to clean NVRAM, as my device could
have strange settings from previous firmware. To do so just type
('''please double check if it is SAFE with your hardware!!!'''): {{{ mtd
-r erase nvram }}} In my case it reduced variable count to 30% of this
what I had originally set with vendor firmware. After ersing nvram, I
strongly recommend to set up a boot\_wait to on. It will really help if
I cause the router to stop working by misconfiguring it. {{{ nvram set
boot\_wait=on nvram commit }}} ==== Basic network settings ==== I
changed SSID to reflect company domain: {{{ nvram set
wl0\_ssid="www.tt-soft.com" nvram commit }}} We need to configure our
WAN port to 80.55.248.83. As we know our static IP, configuration is
very simple: {{{ nvram set wan\_proto=static nvram set
wan\_ipaddr=80.55.248.83 nvram set wan\_netmask=255.255.255.248 nvram
set wan\_gateway=80.55.248.81 nvram set wan\_dns=80.55.248.85 nvram
commit }}} Now lets enable SSH on WAN port. It is disabled by default
and we need it open as we want external access to our device. It is very
easy. Just edit a file /etc/firewall.user, locate lines which looks like
those below and uncomment last two lines: {{{ \#\#\# Open port to WAN
\#\# -- This allows port 22 to be answered by (dropbear on) the router
\# iptables -t nat -A prerouting\_wan -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT \#
iptables -A input\_wan -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT }}}

The router was now mounted and cabled in its working enviroment.

After successfull remote login, I decided to separate WiFi from LAN
ports of the router. Let;s call it unbridge: {{{ nvram set
lan\_ifname=vlan0 (no more bridge) nvram set lan\_ifnames=vlan0 (no more
bridge) nvram set lan\_ipaddr=10.112.170.3 (set lan IP to what we want)
nvram set wifi\_ifname=eth1 (configure WiFi as separate subnet) nvram
set wifi\_proto=static nvram set wifi\_ipaddr=10.98.226.1 nvram set
wifi\_netmask=255.255.255.0 nvram commit (save changes to NVRAM) reboot
}}}

==== Static IP addresses with DHCP ==== First I decided that some well
know machines will have certain fixed IP's. The assigment in vlan0 will
be done based on MAC matching. So I edited /etc/ethers file: {{{
<root@OpenWrt>:\~\# cat /etc/ethers 00:11:0a:b9:19:93 10.112.170.2
00:0F:FE:90:A7:18 10.112.170.41 00:15:B7:FE:74:58 10.112.170.42
00:90:F5:3C:70:E8 10.112.170.43 00:c0:a8:f5:0a:07 10.112.170.44
00:50:8d:4d:95:09 10.112.170.45 00:30:05:ba:04:a7 10.112.170.46
00:04:61:73:60:49 10.112.170.47 00:15:f2:91:c9:a7 10.112.170.48 }}}

==== Adding new subned on VLAN ==== I decided to separate port number 4
to became a port for a separate subnet for guests in hotel that is
located in the same building. First it was necessary to set NVRAM.
Please note that in my confguration port labeled 4 has internal switch
number 0. (This is specific for Linksys GL v.2 !!!) {{{
<root@OpenWrt>:\~\# nvram set vlan0ports="3 2 1 5\*" <root@OpenWrt>:\~\#
nvram set vlan2ports="0 5" <root@OpenWrt>:\~\# nvram set vlan2hwname=et0
<root@OpenWrt>:\~\# nvram commit }}}

Please note that this causes only the ports on switch to became
partitioned. To make an runnig interface you should do: {{{
<root@OpenWrt>:/etc/init.d\# nvram set hotel\_ifname=vlan2
<root@OpenWrt>:/etc/init.d\# nvram set hotel\_proto=static
<root@OpenWrt>:/etc/init.d\# nvram set hotel\_ipaddr=10.90.201.1
<root@OpenWrt>:/etc/init.d\# nvram set hotel\_netmask=255.255.255.0
<root@OpenWrt>:\~\# nvram commit <root@OpenWrt>:/etc/init.d\# ifup hotel
}}}

To pemanently set vlan2 aka hotel up, you need to place hotel interface
in NVRAM variable: {{{ <root@OpenWrt>:\~\# nvram set
ifup\_interfaces="lan wan wifi hotel" <root@OpenWrt>:\~\# nvram commit
}}}

==== Tuning up DNSMASQ ==== First it was ncessary to force OpenWRT to
use /etc/dnsmasq.conf for configuration. To do this, I just added those
two lines at the beginning of /etc/init.d/S60dnsmasq. {{{ dnsmasq exit
}}}

So the file looks now like:

{{{ \#!/bin/sh

\# The following is to automatically configure the DHCP settings \#
based on nvram settings. Feel free to replace all this crap \# with a
simple "dnsmasq" and manage everything via the \# /etc/dnsmasq.conf
config file dnsmasq exit \# DHCP interface (lan, wan, wifi -- any ifup
\*) iface=lan ifname=\$(nvram get \${iface}\_ifname) ... continue ...
}}}

Now I added some lines to /etc/dnsmasq.conf to config DNSMASQ to serve
on three subnets: {{{
dhcp-range=lan,10.112.170.100,10.112.170.250,255.255.255.0,2h
dhcp-range=wlan,10.98.226.100,10.98.226.250,255.255.255.0,15m
dhcp-range=hotel,10.90.201.100,10.90.201.250,255.255.255.0,1h \#set the
default route (3) and dns server (6) for dhcp clients on the subnets
dhcp-option=lan,3,10.112.170.3
dhcp-option=lan,6,10.112.170.3,80.55.248.85
dhcp-option=wlan,3,10.98.226.1 dhcp-option=wlan,6,10.98.226.1
dhcp-option=hotel,3,10.90.201.1 dhcp-option=hotel,6,10.90.201.1 }}}

==== Allowing internet access to new subnets ==== As eth1 and vlan2 are
separate subnets, it is necessery to allow the to access internet. The
easiest way is to put those lines to /etc/firewall.user file: {{{
iptables -A FORWARD -i vlan2 -o vlan1 -j ACCEPT iptables -A FORWARD -i
eth1 -o vlan1 -j ACCEPT }}}
