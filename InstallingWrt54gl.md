!OpenWrt is free software, provided AS-IS under the terms of the GNU
General Public License. Please understand that you are expected to have
knowledge about GNU/Linux and basic networking concepts before you
install !OpenWrt on your router, however, for all intended purposes of
this document it is not required. :) Support may be provided on a

 = Introduction = This guide is intended for beginners to Linux and/or
!OpenWrt. This guide is dedicated to the installation of !OpenWrt on the
!LinkSys WRT54GL router and the experiences gained by the installation.
Installation of !OpenWrt on the WRT54GL is possible, either through the
Firmware upgrade web interface on the !LinkSys router or through tftp on
Windows or Linux. The easiest method by far is installation through the
web interface, mainly because of the small window of opportunity to
connect and transfer !OpenWrt using tftp. The problems of using tftp for
installation on the Wrt54GL and how to overcome those problems are
discussed here as well.

Even though this document focuses on the WRT54GL it is also relevant to
the installation of !OpenWrt in general. So if you are new to Linux and
!OpenWrt, you will save time reading this document, especially if you
are interested in compiling/building your own !OpenWrt source for
installation and are interested in using tftp for installing.

= LinkSys Wrt54GL Hardware = The WRT54GL !LinkSys router was used for
this particular installation. The specs of this router are as follows
which has been taken from the TableOfHardware page. '''Version'''

Do not be concerned with the which version you have. You may want to
take note of which version you have in case you would like to re-install
it (although, even that doesn't matter as you can just go to the
!LinkSys website to download the latest and greatest), however, unlike
what some people say about rolling back versions to take advantage of
the infamous "ping exploit"... well, that's just not needed. Any version
should work fine.

For any of those people interested in connecting serial ports to the
WRT54GL. Single and dual serial boards are available. Two serial
connections can be created using a dual serial board.

= Installing OpenWrt = We are installing !OpenWrt on the !LinkSys
WRT54GL router.

== Select your Hardware == The first thing you want to do is make sure
that your router hardware is supported, since we are using the WRT54GL
linkSys router we are fine, otherwise confirm your hardware on the
TableOfHardware page.

== Select your Firmware == The next step is to locate the variation of
!OpenWrt you want to install. The latest !OpenWrt files can be found at
<http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/7.09/brcm47xx-2.6/>

Before you download the files, continue to read the next two sections as
it explains which file to select.

== Select your .bin/.trx file == In that directory you will notice two
different types of files. "trx" and "bin" files, the bin files simply
repackage the trx in the vendor's default firmware format and are only
used when the trx files can't be used directly. That may be a little
confusing for some people however, since we are using the WRT54GL you
should use:

openwrt-wrt54g-&lt;version&gt;-squashfs.bin

You have to check what flavor fits best to your WRT54GL.

== WRT54GL Connect == Be sure to have your WRT54GL router powered up.
Plug the power adaptor into a standard outlet and plug the other end
into your router. You should see lights on the front of the router. Now
you need to your computer to your router. Your connection may vary based
on your network configuration. To connect your computer directly to the
router run one end of an ethernet cable into your computer's network
card and the other end directly into one of the four numbered ports on
the back of your router (not the internet/LAN port). If you are on a
network and are plugged into a hub you can plug one end of the ethernet
cable into a numbered port on the hub and the other end into a numbered
port on the router (you must unplug the hub's uplink button, which will
disconnect it from the internet). In either case, if you have a
dedicated IP you need to change your IP address so that you can access
the router on the same subnet. For example, if your IP address is
192.168.170.55 change it to 192.168.1.55 and you should be able to
access your router.

To confirm your connection you can try pinging your router (ping
192.168.1.1) or using either Windows or Linux, simply open up your
favorite Web Browser and access page 192.168.1.1. If your !LinkSys
WRT54GL router web interface appears you are connected! If not, you need
to solve this problem before moving forward.

== Installation == So you have the !OpenWrt firmware image downloaded
and have confirmed it isn't corrupt. As well, you have confirmed that
your computer can communicate with the WRT54GL router.

You have two choices for installation, both methods work on both Linux
and Windows. You can can use the LinkSys Web Interface for installing
!OpenWrt or you can use tftp to install !OpenWrt.

If you are not compiling your own !OpenWrt source code, simply install
!OpenWrt using the Routers Web Interface (this is simple... brief
instructions below). In fact, even if you plan on installing your own
self compiled !OpenWrt source code it is easier to install an official
version of !OpenWrt first using the Router's Web Interface. Why you ask?
It's all about boot\_wait.

By default, boot\_wait is "off" on the WRT54GL routers, in fact, most
routers have boot\_wait "off" by default. Turning boot\_wait "on" simply
increases the time it takes to boot. Why is this relevant you may ask?
Well, try using tftp to install !OpenWrt and you'll find out. Some
people claim that atftp for linux is quicker than tftp for windows, this
is not necessarily true although the 'a' in atftp does stand for
"advanced". If you try to install !OpenWrt using tftp on windows, using
tftp on Linux or atftp on Linux you get the same error.

{{{ "error received from server &lt;Invalid Password!!&gt;" }}}

This happens because tftp client cannot access the router's server. Why?
Because there is a small window of opportunity to connect and install
!OpenWrt using tftp and as fast as you try to be it is near impossible
to catch without knowing the trick. Turning Boot\_wait "on" increases
that window of opportunity and makes it easier to catch and install
!OpenWrt using ftp, however, turning Boot\_wait "on" is a task in itself
and varies across routers. Apparently, on some routers you can install
older firmware that enables a ping exploit where commands can be typed
directly into the routers Web Interface to turn Boot\_wait "on" or
"off". This does not work with WRT54GL so do not try to roll back the
firmware, it is not recommended. In fact, turning Boot\_wait "on" for
installing !OpenWrt on the WRT54GL using tftp is not necessary (but it
helps). Apparently Boot\_wait can be turned on through a serial console
and the serial port, however, I have not yet attempted the task, for
more information read page OpenWrtDocs/BootWait.

So, it is recommended that you install an official version of !OpenWrt
first using the Router's Web Interface before using tftp to install your
own self compiled version. This is because once you have installed
!OpenWrt you can access its Web Interface and turn Boot\_wait "on". Then
you can use tftp and have a much easier time installing !OpenWrt. This
is one of the easiest ways to turn on the Boot\_wait option. Hopefully,
it saves you hours of searching the forums.

Just so that you know. You do not need the Boot\_wait option on to
successfully install !OpenWrt using tftp. It does make it easier but
it's not necessary. The trick is to press the reset button and timing.
Run the ftp client, power up the WRT54GL router and hit the reset
button. If that doesn't work the first time, try again, but it does
work.

=== Router Web Interface Installation === To install !Open Wrt using the
router's web interface simply access the web interface page at
192.168.1.1, go to system - &gt; administration - &gt; firmware upgrade.
Locate the !OpenWrt Firmware Image file and that's it. Be sure that the
power supply is stable and not disconnected during transfer. After your
installation depending on the type of !OpenWrt you chose you may need to
restart you router. Many people have reported inconsistent results.
RussNelson notes that v4.30.0 gave the "Upgrade are failed!" error, but
upgrading to Linksys.com's v4.30.5 reflashed OpenWRT just fine.

=== tftp Installation === tftp is mainly recommended for those looking
to install their own self compiled images of !OpenWrt, because it can
also be used to recover from a problem and allow you to put on another
Firmware Image, whether it is !OpenWrt or the original from !LinkSys.
This is only relevant in the event that something happens to the router,
the install was interrupted or the code causes the router to crash. You
can then use tftp to reflash the router with another firmware. If
something happens to you router the Web Interface may not be available
to you. This is where tftp shines!

To install !OpenWrt using atftp on Linux type the command:

atftp --trace --option "timeout 1" --option "mode octet" --put
--local-file openwrt-xxx-x.x-xxx.bin 192.168.1.1

Next power up your router, and hit your reset button. If it doesn't work
keep trying. If you have the "Boot\_wait" option "on" you can probably
turn the router on first, then run the atftp client and skip hitting the
reset button.
