'''OpenVPN via TAP !HowTo'''

\[\[TableOfContents\]\]

= Introduction = This guide originated in this
<http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=8495#p8495> forum post,
written by legodude on 2005-06-18.

It describes using OpenVPN to allow a "road warrior" remote user to
connect to the home network from the wan interface i.e. anywhere on the
internet.\#

This guide describes a TAP-based (bridged tunnel) solution with
preshared keys, for a TUN-based (routed tunnel) with SSL/TLS
certificates, try the slightly different \["OpenVPNTunHowTo"\] (which
was based on this how-to).

For more information regarding the differences between bridging (TAP)
and routing (TUN) and which solution is more appropriate in your case
please see <http://openvpn.net/faq.html#bridge2>.

It has been updated to include fixes to get OpenVPN working on OpenWRT
Kamikaze.

= HowTo = This is a quick !HowTo for getting OpenVPN v2.0 up and running
on OpenWRT. There are many possible ways to configure OpenVPN; the one
we will use here is designed for ease of setup and one server with a few
clients. To that end we will use bridged mode with static keys.

But first some words of caution. This setup works for me. I do not claim
to be an OpenVPN expert and this may have gaping security holes or hose
your system.

== Install Software == This !HowTo assumes an OpenWRT machine will be
the OpenVPN server and a Windows client machine, however, client setup
should be basically the same no matter which OS is used.

To install OpenVPN on OpenWRT, only a simple command is needed:

{{{ ipkg install openvpn }}} Windows users can either download the
standard \[<http://openvpn.net/> OpenVPN distribution\] or get the
\[<http://openvpn.se/> OpenVPN GUI for Windows\] from Mathias Sundman.

Non-Windows clients just follow the OpenVPN install instructions.

== Generate Static Key == Windows users click the icon to generate a
static key. Everyone else run:

{{{ openvpn --genkey --secret secret.key }}} This only needs to be done
once and then copied to all machines to be part of the VPN. I suggest
you create /etc/openvpn on the OpenWRT computer, place the secret.key
file there, and leave everything in the default place on Windows.

== Setup Server == === Bridge Startup === We need to add a script to
start the bridge.

==== White Russian ====

{{{/etc/openvpn/startupscript:}}}

{{{ \#!/bin/sh \#/etc/openvpn/startupscript \# OpenVPN Bridge Config
File \# Creates TAP devices for use by OpenVPN and bridges them into
OpenWRT Bridge \# Taken from <http://openvpn.net/bridge.html> \# Define
Bridge Interface \# Preexisting on OpenWRT br="br0" \# Define list of
TAP interfaces to be bridged, \# for example tap="tap0 tap1 tap2".
tap="tap0" case "\$1" in up) \# Make sure module is loaded insmod tun \#
Build tap devices for t in \$tap; do openvpn --mktun --dev \$t done \#

0.0.0.0 promisc up done ;; down) for t in \$tap; do ifconfig \$t 0.0.0.0
down done for t in \$tap; do brctl delif \$br \$t done for t in \$tap;
do openvpn --rmtun --dev \$t done rmmod tun ;; \*) echo "\$0 {up|down}"
;; esac }}} This file will create the OpenVPN tap devices and add them
to the default OpenWRT ethernet/wifi bridge.

At last the script has to be made executable:

{{{ chmod +x /etc/openvpn/startupscript }}}

==== Kamikaze ====

If you are using Kamikaze follow the startup script instructions for
White Russian, except change the line:

{{{ br="br0" }}} to: {{{ br="br-lan" }}}

=== OpenVPN server config file === {{{/etc/openvpn/server.ovpn:}}}

{{{ \# Which TCP/UDP port should OpenVPN listen on? port 1194 \# TCP or
UDP server? proto udp \# "dev tap" will create an ethernet tunnel. \#
This must be tap0 instead of tap (as previously \# recommended). If only
tap is used, a new tap \# device is created when openvpn is started \#
that isn't bridged to br0 by the script above. dev tap0 \# The keepalive
directive causes ping-like \# messages to be sent back and forth over \#
the link so that each side knows when \# the other side has gone down.
\# Ping every 10 seconds, assume that remote \# peer is down if no ping
received during \# a 120 second time period. keepalive 10 120 \# Enable
compression on the VPN link. \# If you enable it here, you must also \#
enable it in the client config file. ;comp-lzo \# The persist options
will try to avoid \# accessing certain resources on restart \# that may
no longer be accessible because \# of the privilege downgrade.
;persist-key ;persist-tun \# Output a short status file showing \#
current connections, truncated \# and rewritten every minute. status
/etc/openvpn/status.log \# Set the appropriate level of log \# file
verbosity. \# \# 0 is silent, except for fatal errors \# 4 is reasonable
for general usage \# 5 and 6 can help to debug connection problems \# 9
is extremely verbose verb 3 \# Silence repeating messages. At most 20 \#
sequential messages of the same message \# category will be output to
the log. ;mute 20 \#Static Key secret /etc/openvpn/secret.key }}} At
this point you can start OpenVPN for testing:

{{{ openvpn /etc/openvpn/server.ovpn }}} With {{{logread}}} you should
be able to see if it started up normally.

If it does start up but you do not get a connection from the WAN check
if you have a line in your server config file that says: "local
192.168.1.1" and comment it out. This line is marked as optional in the
original OpenVPN distribution, but will not work with the settings
described in this !HowTo.

=== Firewall === To access the VPN from the internet (WAN) the firewall
rules must accept outside connections for your VPN port (e.g. udp-1194).
The firewall rules are stored in {{{/etc/firewall.user}}}. There is
already an example (WR 0.9) for accepting SSH connections from outside,
which can be copied and changed to:

{{{ \#\#\# OpenVPN \#\# allow connections from outside iptables -t nat
-A prerouting\_wan -p udp --dport 1194 -j ACCEPT iptables -A input\_wan
-p udp --dport 1194 -j ACCEPT }}} Also as mentioned in the OpenVPN FAQ
\[<http://openvpn.net/faq.html#ip-forward> ip\_foward must be enabled\]
(\[<http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=20428#p20428> default in
WR 0.9\]) and \[<http://openvpn.net/faq.html#firewall> packets for the
OpenVPN interfaces have to be allowed/forwarded\]:

{{{ \#\# allow input/forwarding for the VPN interfaces, see
<http://openvpn.net/faq.html#firewall> \#\# also needs ip\_forward, see
<http://openvpn.net/faq.html#ip-forward> and
<http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=20428#p20428> iptables -A
INPUT -i tap+ -j ACCEPT iptables -A FORWARD -i tap+ -j ACCEPT }}} If you
want to block DoS attacks then have a look at
\[<http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=7493> this forum thread\].
It is based on the information of the documents
\["OpenWrtDocs/IPTables"\] and ThrottleConnectionsHowTo. It also
provides an example how to access SSH via a non-standard port (e.g. 443
for restrictive firewalls) although SSH is still running on the standard
port 22. You can easily adopt it to VPN.

If it is intended that keys are sent via SSH across the WAN, then also
enable accepting SSH connections from outside:

{{{ \#\#\# SSH (optional) \#\# allow connections from outside iptables
-t nat -A prerouting\_wan -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT iptables -A
input\_wan -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT }}} == Configure Client == Client
configuration is pretty simple. First, transfer over the key file. This
can be done by "scp" which is a file transfer over SSH. Example:

{{{ scp <root@192.168.1.1>:/etc/openvpn/secret.key /etc/openvpn/ }}} Now
place the following file in the config directory and remember to change
the server IP address to match, as well as the secrets file.

{{{ dev tap proto udp \# The hostname/IP and port of the server. \# You
can have multiple remote entries \# to load balance between the servers.
remote Your.IP.Goes.Here 1194 \# Keep trying indefinitely to resolve the
\# host name of the OpenVPN server. Very useful \# on machines which are
not permanently connected \# to the internet such as laptops.
resolv-retry infinite \# Most clients don't need to bind to \# a
specific local port number. nobind \# Try to preserve some state across
restarts. ;persist-key ;persist-tun \# Wireless networks often produce a
lot \# of duplicate packets. Set this flag \# to silence duplicate
packet warnings. mute-replay-warnings secret secret.key \# Enable
compression on the VPN link. \# Don't enable this unless it is also \#
enabled in the server config file. ;comp-lzo \# Set log file verbosity.
verb 3 \# Silence repeating messages ;mute 20 \# Allow LAN IP to reply
to client float }}} Now that should be it. Start the OpenVPN client
either through the GUI or command line and it should link up.

== Wrap Up == If your setup did not work then it is time to start
reading the quite excellent OpenVPN documentation. The \#openvpn channel
on Freenode is also quite helpful.

If your setup is working fine then the only remaining step is to
automate the startup of the OpenVPN server on the OpenWRT machine. To
this end create the following file:

=== White Russian === {{{/etc/init.d/S46openvpn:}}}

{{{ \#!/bin/sh case "\$1" in start) /etc/openvpn/startupscript up
openvpn --daemon --config /etc/openvpn/server.ovpn ;; restart) \$0 stop
sleep 3 \$0 start ;; reload) killall -SIGHUP openvpn ;; stop) killall
openvpn /etc/openvpn/startupscript down ;; esac }}} At last the script
has to be made executable:

{{{ chmod 0755 /etc/init.d/S46openvpn }}}

Now on a reboot, the server should come up.

=== Kamikaze === {{{/etc/init.d/openvpn:}}}

{{{ \#!/bin/sh

START=65 STOP=35

start() {

:   /etc/openvpn/startupscript up openvpn --daemon --config
    /etc/openvpn/server.ovpn

}

restart() {

:   \$0 stop sleep 3 \$0 start

}

reload() {

:   killall -SIGHUP openvpn

}

stop() {

:   killall openvpn /etc/openvpn/startupscript down

}
=

At last the script has to be made executable and enabled to run at
startup:

{{{ chmod +x /etc/init.d/openvpn /etc/init.d/openvpn enable }}}

Now on a reboot, the server should come up.
