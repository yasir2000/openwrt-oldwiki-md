= Introduction = The howto part of this section can be read as a
description howto get as far as got configuring l2tp over ipsec.
Corrections are highly appreciated.

The l2tp-daemon used to cause trouble. So the ipsec section is kept as
easy as possible just to be able to communicate with l2tpd.

\[\[TableOfContents\]\] = Howto = Read
<http://www.jacco2.dds.nl/networking/freeswan-l2tp.html> which is a very
useful and detailed description on how to setup l2tp over ipsec

Instructions are for rc5 on a wrt54gs1.1

== Divide wireless from wired network == Divide the wireless from the
wired network as described in \["Configuration"\]

== Base Configuration == The wrt has 10.1.1.1 on at least one
wired-port, the rig you're using to configure the stuff has 10.1.1.2 on
the wire. The wrt has 10.1.10.1 on the wireless interface, where your
test rig has 10.1.10.2. Netmasks are 255.255.255.0 in both cases -
Firewall is set up to allow everything.

The following relies on this configuration.

== Needed Packages == You need to install OpenSwan and the OpenSwan
Kernel-Modules {{{ ipkg install openswan kmod-openswan}}}

Aslo install the L2TPd package. Use patched version:

{{{ ipkg install
<http://psg.com/~brian/software/openwrt/l2tpd_0.70pre-2_mipsel.ipk>}}}

== Debug stuff which is not needed for the real setup == To debug your
setup it is a good idea to install tcpdump and nmap right away (if You
have enough space):

{{{ ipkg install tcpdump nmap }}}

Also helpful thing is watching the syslog.

{{{ logread}}}

== Configure IPSec == ipsec.conf should look like this:

{{{ config setup interfaces="ipsec0=eth1"

conn L2TP-PSK

:   authby=secret ike=aes-sha,3des-sha esp=aes-sha1,3des-sha1 pfs=no
    rekey=no keyingtries=3 left=10.1.10.1 leftprotoport=17/1701
    right=%any rightprotoport=17/%any auto=add

\#Disable Opportunistic Encryption include
/etc/ipsec.d/examples/no\_oe.conf }}}

/etc/ipsec.secrets

{{{ 10.1.10.1 %any: PSK "this-is-a-test-i-will-change-it-later" }}}

Very important thing is to make it readable to root only.

{{{ chmod 400 /etc/ipsec.secrets}}}

It's time for a first test:

Now lets see wether this part is working: Reboot and bring up tcpdump on
the ipsec interface

{{{ tcpdump -i ipsec0 }}}

Now - when you connect to your wrt using your l2tp/ipsec client it
should not work yet - but in case you set things up correctly you should
see incoming packages on ipsec0.

If You don't have tcpdump installed You can just check ipsec0 statistics
for that:

{{{ ifconfig ipsec0}}}

== Configure l2tpd == /etc/l2tpd/l2tpd.conf

{{{ \[global\]

\[lns default\] ip range = 10.1.1.202-10.1.1.220 local ip = 10.1.1.201
require chap = yes refuse pap = yes require authentication = yes name =
home ppp debug = yes pppoptfile = /etc/ppp/options.l2tpd length bit =
yes }}}

/etc/ppp/options.l2tpd

{{{ ipcp-accept-local ipcp-accept-remote ms-dns 10.1.10.1 noccp auth
crtscts idle 1800 mtu 1400 mru 1400 nodefaultroute debug lock proxyarp
connect-delay 5000 }}}

/etc/ppp/chap-secrets

{{{ \#USERNAME PROVIDER PASSWORD IPADDRESS duffy \* "duck" \* }}}

== Load Modules == add the following lines to /etc/modules and reboot
(or load the modules via insmod and skip reboot)

{{{ slhc ppp\_generic ppp\_async }}}

== RUN == Now (hopefully) everything is set up and we have to test it:
run the l2tpd:

{{{ l2tpd -D }}}

If everyhing works fine You can start the deamon using init script:

{{{ /etc/init.d/l2tpd start}}}

To ensure that l2tpd will start on boot, rename l2tpd to S65l2tpd for
example. = Todo = Make ipsec use certificates.

Update the /etc/firewall.user script

Show how to configure ipsec to listen of more than one interface.

Client configuration.

= Errors = Hopefully You shouldn't get any.
