== What is alice == Alice is an Italian internet provider previously
known as telecom italia... i have done this with a 20Mb connection the
setup can be a little bit different for others connections such as the
username/password that may be the one they gave you(in the case you have
a connection with a time limit)

== The problem == The problem is that you receive a modem/router (alice
gate) that by default act like a router...and OpenWrt doesn't run on
it...and you want your openwrt router to be directly connected to the
internet so you can provides services such as openssh,openvpn or open
ports for p2p or msn,ekiga

== The Setup of the intenet == as i never succeeded to use the wifi we
will connect trough the cable so: 1. connect trough an ethernet cable 2.
go to a website and you will be redirected to a page telling you to
register for a mail 3. i used don't accept as there told you that there
are adds inside your mailbox if you accepted and at the end it worked 4.
restart the alice gate pressing the red button on the alice gate...and
do it again until you have the internet...

== The transformation of the router in modem == 1. open your browser to
<http://192.168.1.1>

2.  go below "modalita bridged+router" there is "connessione automatica
    da modem/router" like on this image:
    <http://www.intilinux.com/wp-content/w2+menu.JPG>

and click on "disattiva" == Disable alice's wifi == if you want more
security and an incrased range or signal quality on your openwrt you
should disactivate the wifi

1.  connect to the alice box
2.  go in wifi
3.  disable it
4.  confirm

== OpenWrt's setup == 1. connect your openwrt router to the alice-gate
with a normal(non cross) ethernet cable 2. modify the wan configuration
inside /etc/config/network:

{{{

:   \#\#\#\# WAN configuration config interface wan option ifname
    "eth0.1" option proto pppoe option username "username" option
    password "password"

}}} the username and password are realy "username" and "password" and
evry combinations works
