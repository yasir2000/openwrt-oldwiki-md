The RDC port is a port of OpenWrt to the RDC R321x(-G) and R861x(-G)
SoC's. These are x86-compatible chips. The "86" in the designation
represents the industrial version, while "32" represents the commercial
version. The last digit is "0" for ones with USB, and "1" for ones
without. RDC's website had a datasheet each for the R8610 and the
R8610-G, but they have been removed. Most info there applied to the
aforementioned derivatives the way one would expect. Devices that use
this chipset include:

> -   Airlink 101 AR525W
> -   Edimax BR-6216Mg
> -   Gemtek WRTR-137G
> -   Longshine LCS-WR-2114M
> -   Sitecom WL-153
> -   Sitecom WL-176
> -   Linksys WRT54GR

== Status ==

The RDC support was started in October 2006 in the Kamikaze branch and
is now considered stable with squashfs images. == TODO ==

Find all GPIO lines.

== Hardware differences ==

The Sitecom WL-153, Longshine LCS-WR-2114M and Edimax BR-6216Mg (and
other devices which are simply rebranded Edimax devices) seem to be
equiped with just 2 MB of flash (Macronix 29LV160CBTC-70G chip) and 16
MB RAM. Other devices apparently have 4 MB flash.
