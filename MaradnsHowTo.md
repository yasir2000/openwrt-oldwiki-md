= Overview = MaraDNS is a full featured DNS server and can be used as a
replacement for the DNS part of dnsmasq. Its main advantage over dnsmasq
is that it supports redundant DNS setups, using primary and secondary
servers. It is available as an ipkg and can be easily installed. It
comes with extensive documentation in english and french which can be
found \[<http://www.4haus.buettemeyer.net/playground/maradns.doc/>
here\]. The best starting point is the
\[<http://www.4haus.buettemeyer.net/playground/maradns.doc/en/tutorial/tutorial.html>
good tutorial\].

== Components == The main MaraDNS configuration file is located in
{{{/etc/mararc}}} and you have 4 main programs:

> -   {{{maradns}}}: dns server; answers requests from clients
> -   {{{askmara}}}: corresponding query tool; like dig or nslookup
> -   {{{zoneserver}}}: zone transfer server; answers requests from
>     secondary servers
> -   {{{getzone}}}: corresponding query tool; like dig -axfr

= Configurations = Depending on what you are trying to do with MaraDNS,
you'll need to integrate some or all of the above tools.

== Recursive Server == If you want MaraDNS to act as a recursive and/or
authoritative server, you may need to edit {{{/etc/mararc}}} and run
maradns in the background through {{{/etc/init.d/S60maradns}}}, which is
installed along with the ipkg. See
\[<http://www.4haus.buettemeyer.net/playground/maradns.doc/en/tutorial/recursive.html>
this\] part of the MaraDNS tutorial for instructions and examples.

Normally you can stick with the defaults provided by the ipkg, but you
may need to customize the following line in {{{/etc/mararc}}} to match
your network:

{{{ recursive\_acl="192.168.1.0/24" }}} If you want to tie the process
to a specific interface, edit the {{{bind\_address}}} parameter. This
defaults to 0.0.0.0 meaning any interface.

You may also want to remove the {{{run\_as\_root=1}}} parameter and
replace it with {{{maradns\_uid=65534}}}.

== Primary Server == If you want to act as a primary server to other
secondaries, you'll also need to start zoneserver and set up a new
init-script for that. You can either set up a new file
{{{/etc/init.d/S60zoneserver}}} like this:

{{{ \#!/bin/sh /usr/sbin/zoneserver &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&1 & }}} Or you
can append the above command to the existing file
{{{/etc/init.d/S60maradns}}}.

You also need to add your zonefiles to {{{/etc/maradns/}}} in MaraDNS's
\[<http://www.4haus.buettemeyer.net/playground/maradns.doc/en/tutorial/man.csv1.html>
CSV1 format\]. Detailed instructions can be found
\[<http://www.4haus.buettemeyer.net/playground/maradns.doc/en/tutorial/authoritative.html>
here\].

== Secondary Server == If you want to act as a secondary server, you'll
need to do regular zonetransfers with getzone. See
\[<http://www.4haus.buettemeyer.net/playground/maradns.doc/en/faq.html#secondary>
this FAQ\] for more information.

Generally you want to run a command like this on either a regular basis
or triggered by some external event:

{{{ getzone domain.test 192.168.1.2 &gt; /etc/maradns/db.domain.test }}}
Where {{{domain.test}}} is the domain name, {{{192.168.1.2}}} is the
primary name server and {{{db.domain.test}}} is the filename of the
zonefile. You will also have to restart maradns and/or zoneserver after
you transferred to zones. The HowtoEnableCron document explains how to
configure cron on your OpenWrt system.

= dnsmasq Considerations = If your MaraDNS machine also provides DHCP
services, you probably use dnsmasq for that task. dnsmasq also provides
DNS services and there is no way to shut that part off. To avoid errors
about ports being already in use, you have to change to default
bahaviour of dnsmasq. More informatio about dnsmasq in general can be
found at OpenWrtDocs/dnsmasq.

== Hiding dnsmasq == To hide dsnmasq's DNS server on a different port,
you have to add a line like this to your dnsmasq.conf:

{{{ port=5353 }}} Change that to any free, unused port you like and use
your packet filter to block traffic to that port.

== Separating internal and external DNS == It is possible to run dnsmasq
and MaraDNS concurrently and have both listen on different interfaces.
This allows for the seperation of internal and external DNS services, as
detailed by synthrax on
\[<http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=4558> this post\]:

I have both maradns and dnsmasq running on port 53. maradns serves
public dns at the wan interface and dnsmasq takes care of the private
subnet. in order for both to get along, you have to start maradns BEFORE
dnsmasq.

Additionally, you need to have the line:

{{{ bind\_address="external\_ip" }}} in your mararc file. To start the
two name servers, i slightly modified /etc/init.d/S50dnsmasq:

{{{ \#!/bin/sh . /etc/functions.sh \# maradns stuff starts here
publicip=\$(whatismyip vlan1) zonefile=/etc/maradns/my\_dns\_zone cat
\$zonefile.template sed s/external\_ip/\$publicip/ &gt; /etc/mararc
/usr/sbin/maradns &gt;/var/log/maradns 2&gt;&1 & \# maradns stuff ends
here \# interface to use for DHCP iface=lan \[...the script
continues...\] }}} this script does the following things:

> 1.  it determines my external (wan) IP with a script i got from the
>     openwrt wiki (whatismyip) \[<http://wiki.openwrt.org/MiniHowtos>
>     MiniHowtos Section 3.3\]. Instead of hardcoding "vlan1", better to
>     say:

{{{ publicip=\$(whatismyip \$(nvram get wan\_ifname)) }}} 2. it rewrites
my maradns zone file to insert the external ip (just put "external\_ip"
in place of the actual ip in the zone template) 2. it rewrites mararc to
insert the correct IP in "bind\_address=..." 2. finally, it starts
maradns After maradns has started, port 53 of the external iface will be
"occupied", which dnsmasq will complain about in the syslog
("\[dnsmasq\] setting --bind-interfaces option because of OS
limitations"). you can safely ignore this message or you could probably
start dnsmasq explicitly with the --bind-interfaces option to get rid of
the message. i didn't, as i'm too lazy. Now, am adding two more options
apart from the normal ones:

{{{ dnsmasq -a \$(whatismyip \$(nvram get lan\_ifname)) -z }}} BTW: this
works fine for me, as my internet provider does (almost) never change my
assigned IP. if you have a provider which changes your ip with every
dhcp lease period or so, you would probably need to place something
similar in /etc/hotplug.d/iface (or i don't know where)
