[b]Introduction[/b]
[table][tr][td][/td][td]
[url=http://xwrt.berlios.de/xwrt.asp]Webif^2[/url] is based on Openwrt's web administration tool, Webif, with the thought that there is no need to reinvent the wheel
- we just need to grease the axel a bit.

Webif^2 tries to add functions that can help novice users quicker into Openwrt
- one may not even have to go to the command line (well almost never).

Therefor much of what may be written here applies to Webif.

An interesting historical document is the Openwrt thread [url=http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=12558#p12558]WANTED: Web interface developers[/url]

"Programmers Guide to webif^2" is the only documentaion available, unless you read the code.
It is the Dummy's guide based on this dummy's research as an outsider to the webif^2 developement.

IF you feel that you can make a difference, post a NEW topic saying which module you may be able to do and see if someone else is doing the same thing: maybe cooperate and make OpenFriends.

OR if you are a good shell programmer with no original ideas (like me), look thru the code to see if there are many repeats of code that could be made as library functions. I'm sure the guys at X-Wrt are busy solving problems and creating new features and may sometimes not have the time to go the code with a critical (but constructive) eye.
