== What is this AR7 stuff? ==

\[<http://focus.ti.com/pdfs/bcg/ar7wi_fact_sheet.pdf> AR7\] is a router
platform by Texas Instruments, which is used for routers and ADSL
gateways.

See the \[:TableOfHardware\] for supported AR7 routers.

See \[:OpenWrtDocs/InstallingAR7\] if you are brave enough to test it.

== Finished tasks ==

Our Kernel support for AR7 is in SVN trunk. Here's what we have
integrated so far (for Linux kernel 2.4, no longer supported):

> -   A kernel that boots up to the part where it tries to mount the
>     root filesystem
> -   A simple mtd flash map driver that uses the boot loader's
>     partition map
> -   Running a shell with a modified OpenWrt rootfs works!
> -   We have working (and free) drivers for Ethernet and ADSL in SVN!
> -   The flash map driver is working, but needs more testing
> -   We have the source for the TI WLAN driver
> -   With the new stuff in SVN, it now sets up the networking stuff, so
>     you can log in via telnet on 192.168.1.1 (or whatever you
>     configured in menuconfig). That can be changed in
>     /etc/config/network
> -   The VLYNQ bus works
> -   The LZMA loader works and is integrated
> -   Support for WAG354G is integrated, still needs testing...
> -   ADSL works! New init scripts for PPPoE are integrated.
> -   Scripts for flashing DSL-G664T and G604T

The latest contributions add experimental AR7 support for Linux 2.6:

> -   Automatic detection of RAM size.
> -   Automatic detection of PHY (Ethernet Physical Layer).
> -   ADSL works, status of ADSL+ support is not clear.
> -   Ethernet works (but still needs some fixes - maybe fixed in kernel
>     2.6.22.4).
> -   WLAN works with free ACX111 driver (no WPA/WPA2).
> -   There is also an acx-mac80211 driver, but as yet (r9450) this
>     driver is incapable of AP mode.

The latest Linux kernel 2.6.22.4 is now supported for AR7.

== Bugs / Ugly-Hacks ==

I would like to keep a list of the bugs and ugly-hacks used to make the
ar7 work, so that they can be removed.

> -   '''arch/mips/ar7/reset.c''': the functions are empty. Please
>     implement this '''without''' using the tnetd code, if possible.
>     (reboot works now, shutdown/halt does not yet.) -- nbd: for halt,
>     you probably only need {{{ \_\_cli() + while(1); }}} z3ro: there
>     are some tnetd functions for halt... hopefully we can use the code
>     from these without needing all of the tnetd code. enrik: I have
>     some improvements for the code including a jump back to ADAM2 on
>     halt. Will send patch soon.
> -   '''arch/mips/kernel/setup.c''': We have some \#ifdef CONFIG\_AR7
>     ... \#else ... \#endif because of the memory offset, we should use
>     the generics here and modify the functions in mm/bootmem.c (this
>     will kill some \#ifdef CONFIG\_AR7's in other files, too.)
> -   '''arch/mips/mm/init.c''': These \#ifdef CONFIG\_AR7's are related
>     to not having the proper code in mm/bootmem.c, see previous list
>     item. enrik: I have generalized the arch/mips/kernel and .../setup
>     code to always use the more general bootmem-functions and done
>     some initialization cleanup, too. Will send patch soon.
> -   LED/pin driver is in a mess. Proc entry is named /proc/led/led
>     instead of /proc/led\_mod/led as was in original
>     2.4.17\_mvl21-malta-mips\_fp\_le kernel, writing to in does
>     nonthing, reading leads to "Unable to handle kernel paging
>     request" exception. Entry /proc/led\_mod/ar7reset, that was
>     present in original kernel and was reading state of "reset" pin in
>     back of device, is completely missing.
> -   Please document any more bugs/ugly-hacks found.

== TODO ==

> -   Complete the init scripts, remove nvram dependencies where they
>     are still present...
> -   Test WAG354G support
> -   Fix the wireless driver (fixed with Linux 2.6)
> -   Fix VLYNQ interrupt and reset handling (needed for the wireless
>     driver). See <http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=2654> for
>     possible patches. (fixed with Linux 2.6)
> -   Generalize scripts/dlink.pl so that it works with other ADAM2
>     versions as well (like FritzBox)
> -   Get voicedump (VP101X120C) supported (Voice over ip chip on
>     Siemens and SMC based hardware)
> -   Get Marvel 88E6060 switch supported (on sx541,smc and castlenet)
>     sources are in avm current open source. (maybe fixed with Linux
>     2.6) also in LevelOne
>     \[<http://global.level1.com/products2.php?Id=534> FBR-1416A\]
>     under dedicated kernel option CONFIG\_MIPS\_AR7\_MARVELL
> -   Add USB support
> -   Support AR7 devices running in big endian mode (Zyxel!)

summary).

== Firmware/Bootloader ==

There are at least 4 variants

> -   Telogy Networks, Inc \["ADAM2"\] + Linux - most Linux based AR7
>     devices
> -   TI PSP bootloader \["PSPBoot"\] + Linux - WAG354G, WRTP54G,
>     ADSL2MUE, others
> -   \[:Bootbase\] + ZyNOS - ZyXEL Prestige 660 Series, maybe other
>     ZyXEL series
> -   Broad Net Technology, Inc. BRN bootloader and VxWorks (realtime OS
>     with SOHO.BIN) - most (all?) VxWorks based devices, e.g. Sinus 154
>     DSL Basic, Siemens SX 541, SMC SMC7908VoWBRB, SMC7904WBRB2.

Note: Even on VxWorks based routers with the BRN bootloader, it is
possible to install Linux and OpenWrt! See
<http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=2654> for more details.

There are also at least two variants of ADAM2. My version (0.22.06)
allows flashing of each mtdblock by ftp, others have reported they must
flash a complete image via '''t'''ftp TFTP is probably specific to
CyberTAN-based stuff (almost exclusively Linksys). All other vendors
seem to use FTP

There are two ADAM2 environment controlling boot process:

> -   autoload = 0|1
> -   autoload\_timeout = N sec.

= Emulation =

You can use the MIPS emulator QEMU to emulate an AR7 based router in
software. See <http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=5488> for more
details.

= How to help =

If you want to help and got some basic kernel hacking knowledge, you
should start by familiarizing yourself with the OpenWrt build system. It
now has support for building images for non-broadcom hardware. All the
kernel and image stuff is in the target/ subdirectory.

AR7-specific kernel patches go into
{{{target/linux/linux-2.4/patches/ar7}}}. The build system part that
constructs the firmware images for AR7 based routers is in
{{{target/linux/image/ar7}}}. You can also find the kernel loader there.

If you'd like to help out and maybe have a patch or two, please talk to
one of the developers working on this via IRC in the OpenWrt channel.
Some people working on this are: nbd, wbx, wickus, z3ro, ralf, mache,
[sw]() and ydef.

== IRC ==

There is a specifically targeted \#ar7 irc channel complementary to
\#openwrt on Freenode where those devoted to hacking ar7 based routers
go to hang out.

= Other stuff = == Model-specific information == Mode-specific
information can be found on that model's page. See
\["CategoryAR7Device"\]. == JTAG ==

The AR7 is based on ejtag version 2.6.

This EJTAG layout should support all AR7 based boards with a 14 pin jtag
pinout. The same cable as used for the standard wrt54g (based on the
xilinx III/dlc-5) as demonstrated by HairyDairyMaid can be constructed
and is well documented. Debug INT pin 13 is optional and pin 14 can be
left unhooked for passive cabling.

Since DMA Routines do NOT exist for this ejtag version (compared to
ejtag v2.0 supported on the wrt54g) interfacing requires a rewrite
utilizng prAcc routines of the v2.6 standard.

JTAGInterface\] (Italian!)

<http://openwince.sourceforge.net/jtag/iPAQ-3600/images/interface.png>

As of 2008-01 there is a new, actively developed fork of openwince JTAG
tools with EJTAG driver included, named "UrJTAG": <http://urjtag.org> -
it should be working with AR7 based boards as well (try latest version
from Subversion repository). This is usable on Speedport(AVM)routers
with more as one chip on the chain. Some bsd definition files must be
created first to discribe the chain in use. Still up to now i just could
dsplay the chips and do some register setting but could not read or
write the flash memory attatched to the TNETV7200 CPU.

it is possible to use derivative of jtag-tools (GPL) with EJTAG driver
included to work with flash on AR7 based boards
<http://star.oai.pp.ru/jtag/jtag-brecis-ok.zip> It works with
Xilinx-cable (5 resistors).
