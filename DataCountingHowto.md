= How to Counting? = This is only mini example data counting script in
Perl and shell, you can download it here:
<http://opensource.smrtak.com/fdrouter/fdrouter_alpha01.tar> .

== Requirement == \* Perl

'''ipkg install
<ftp://ftp.riss-telecom.ru/pub/openwrt/local/whiterussian/packages/perl/perl_5.8.7-1_mipsel.ipk>'''

== Instalation == 1. Copy folder "fdrouter" to /etc/.

2\. Edit /etc/fdrouter/users.csv file, and enter persons in format:
IP;MAC-ADDR;USER-NAME (i.e: 192.168.0.1;00:00:00:00:00:00;smrtak)

3.  Copy init.d script from /fdrouter/scripts/S37fdrouter to
    /etc/init.d/ and give him permission for running.

'''cp /etc/fdrouter/scripts/S37fdrouter /etc/init.d/

chmod 774 /etc/init.d/S37fdrouter'''

4.  Create file /etc/crontabs/root and put here this line:

'''*/5* \* \* \* /etc/fdrouter/stats.sh'''

5.  Copy files from /fdrouter/web to /www and file /www/cgi-bin/data.sh
    must have permissions for running.

'''cp /etc/fdrouter/web/data.sh /www/cgi-bin/

chmod 774 /www/cgi-bin/data.sh'''

6.  this is all

== Using web interface == Go to web server yours router (i.e.
<http://192.168.0.1/cgi-bin/data.sh> ) You can see your data limit for
month, when you are in users.csv.

You can too use adress <http://192.168.0.1/cgi-bin/data.sh?ip=all> and
here is list all users for given month.
