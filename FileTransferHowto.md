'''Transfer files to and from the Wrt'''

\[\[TableOfContents\]\]

= Introduction =

Sometimes it's useful to exchange files between your PC and the Wrt
router. This is the case when you like to make a backup of some files or
install extra packages offline.

= Requirements =

> \* You need to have !OpenWrt installed (should work with almost any
> version, old ones too) \* The programs for the method you have chosen
> installed on your PC

= Methods to transfer files =

'''TIP:''' Remember to set a password with {{{passwd}}}.

== Transfer files onto the Wrt ==

=== via SCP (Secure Copy) ===

On the PC connected to the Wrt execute:

{{{ <user@host>:\~\$ scp /tmp/foobar.txt <root@192.168.1.1>:/tmp }}}

This command copies the {{{/tmp/foobar.txt}}} file from the PC to the
Wrt with the IP address {{{192.168.1.1}}} into the {{{/tmp}}} directory.

== Receiving files from the Wrt ==

=== via SCP (Secure Copy) ===

{{{ <user@host>:\~\$ scp <root@192.168.1.1>:/tmp/foobar.txt /tmp }}}

Copies a {{{/tmp/foobar.txt}}} from the Wrt to {{{/tmp}}} on the PC.

=== via wget ===

Start a second HTTPD webserver process on the Wrt with

{{{ httpd -p 81 -h /tmp -r OpenWrt }}}

than use wget on your PC to receive the file

{{{ <user@host>:\~\$ wget <http://192.168.1.1:81/foobar.txt> }}}

Recieve the file {{{foobar.txt}}} from your router at {{{192.168.1.1}}}
and port 81.

=== via a web browser ===

Start a second HTTPD webserver process (if not done already) on the Wrt
with

{{{ httpd -p 81 -h /tmp -r OpenWrt }}}

than point your favourite web browser to the URL:

{{{ <http://192.168.1.1:81/foobar.txt> }}}
