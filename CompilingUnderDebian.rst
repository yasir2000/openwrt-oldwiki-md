Debian Linux provides a great build environment, but there's a few packages you'll have to add first. This list is for the Sarge version of Debian, OpenWRT Kamikazee build 3268. This list is not exclusive, but is rather those packages which are needed beyond the base Debian Sarge with development tools. As root, perform:

 . apt-get install unzip zlib1g-dev ncurses-dev subversion gettext bison flex autoconf
You may then fetch the source and build it, following the commands listed on http://dev.openwrt.org
