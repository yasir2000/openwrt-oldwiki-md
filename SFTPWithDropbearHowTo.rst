= Introduction =

This HOWTO explains how to configure SFTP for use with the Dropbear SSH package.
Dropbear is typically used because of its small size and pre-installation in White
Russian.


== What is SFTP? ==

Secure File Transfer Protocol or SFTP is a protocol that was incorporated as part
of SSH. The idea behind SFTP is to have all of the features that FTP has, but
transfer both passwords and file data over an encrypted link.


= Activating Dropbear =

Dropbear is a small SSH daemon that comes pre-installed on White Russian. However,
while Dropbear comes pre-installed it is not active by default. To activate Dropbear
use the following command

{{{
passwd
}}}

After you enter this command, you will be prompted to input the password that you want
to assign the user {{{root}}}. Once this is done, White Russian will disable the telnet
daemon and activate the SSH daemon.


= Installing the SFTP module =

To install the SFTP portion enter the following commands:

{{{
ipkg update
ipkg install openssh-sftp-server
mkdir -p /usr/libexec
ln -s /usr/lib/sftp-server /usr/libexec/sftp-server
}}}


= Windows SFTP clients =

Once both SSH and SFTP are installed you will be able to securely access the routers
files via a secure connection. Two of the most popular clients that support SFTP are the
[http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/ Putty SFTP client] and the
[http://filezilla.sourceforge.net/ FileZilla] graphical client. While the !FileZilla
client is actually built upon the Putty client they will be treated here as if they are
two distinct clients.


== FileZilla ==

The !FileZilla client is an ideal choice for most Windows users. The graphical interface
and relatively small learning curve allows the user to begin actively using the software
immediately.

See the [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=21558 download page] and the
[http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=21558 userâ€™s forum].


== Putty SFTP ==

Called PSFTP the Putty SFTP client is a robust and stable implementation of the secure file
transfer protocol. While good, Putty's client is command-line based.  If you are used to
graphical clients, use !FileZilla instead.
