= Freifunk on OpenWRT Kamikaze = This wikipage is intended as a starting
point for discussions about the requirements, architecture and
implementation guidelines for OpenWRT Kamikaze Freifunk addons and/or
the new Lua-Webinterface in general.

== Preliminary Thoughts ==

:   -   The Freifunk addon for Kamikaze will be primarily a different or
        modified web interface since most of the required core
        functionality is already provided by OpenWRT
    -   The web interface will consist of a public part, visible for
        everyone and an adminstrative part only accesible after a
        successful authentication
    -   The language for implementing required CGI scripts is Lua
    -   CGI scripts should access the central configuration through the
        uci command or libuci
    -   CGI scripts should generate all output through a template
        framework, preferably with i18n capabilities
    -   CGI scripts should not access the system directly, but using a
        kind of abstraction layer for determining system-specific
        settings, devices, environment variables etc.
    -   Generated HTML should conform to XHTML 1.0 strict, if applicable
    -   No core functionality should solely depend on Java-Script

== Suggestions for Architecture == The framework for writing a Freifunk
webinterface will be roughly divided in three parts:

> -   A library for accessing the central configuration through uci
> -   A template framework for generating html code and doing automatic
>     translation
> -   An abstraction layer to access system specific data

Some candidates for the templating toolkit and form-processing
capabilities etc. are \[<http://haserl.sourceforge.net/> Haserl\] (GPL
v2) or \[<http://www.keplerproject.org/cgilua/> CGILua\] (BSD-like
