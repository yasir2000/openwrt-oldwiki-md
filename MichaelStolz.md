I own/manage some OpenWRT/DD-WRT compatible devices that I flashed with
either DD-WRT, OpenWRT or Oleg's firmware:

> -   Linksys WRT54GL
> -   Asus WL-HDD
> -   Yakumo Wireless Storage
> -   Buffalo WHR-HP-G54
> -   Asus WL-500g

I also own 2 devices that should be compatible with OpenWRT Kamikaze but
I haven't verified it:

> -   PC Engines alix1c and alix2c3

Unfortunately I have also come in contact with some less friendly
(wireless) routers which I couldn't flash:

> -   ZyXEL Prestige 660HW-63
> -   DLink DI-???
> -   Thomson Speedtouch 536
> -   \[<http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livebox> Inventel/Orange Livebox\]

At the moment my main router at home is a "Fritz!Box Fon WLAN 7140
(A/CH)". Nice gadget ;-)
