'''New FAQ for the stable !OpenWrt White Russian release candidates.'''

\[\[TableOfContents\]\]

= Installation = == Will OpenWrt run on &lt;fill in the blank&gt; ? ==
Please check \["OpenWrtDocs/Hardware"\] and the TableOfHardware for the
list of supported units.

== How do I identify my hardware version? == The model and version
numbers are always printed on the unit.

'''Linksys models'''

For Linksys models look on the bottom for a silver and black linksys
sticker and find the words "Model No". The model number will be printed
followed by a "vN.N" where "N.N" is the version. The exception to this
is the v1.0 revisions, "v1.0" is never printed; if you don't see a
version number it's a v1.0.

If you haven't installed !OpenWrt yet, another way of identifying the
hardware is to open the page <http://192.168.1.1/SysInfo.htm> (where
{{{192.168.1.1}}} should be replaced with the IP address of your WRT54G
or WRT54GS). The last line in the output shows the hardware version.

Linksys routers can also be identified by the first 4 characters/digits
of the Serial Number:

WRT54G Models: | '''Hardware Ver.''' | CDF0 | | v1.0 | CDF2 | | v1.1 |
CDF5 | | v2.2 | CDF8 | | v3.1 | CDFA | | v5.0 | CDFC | | v6.0 ||

WRT54GL Models: | '''Hardware Ver.''' | CL7A | | v1.1 ||

WRT54GS Models: | '''Hardware Ver.''' | CGN0 | | v1.0 | CGN2 | | v2.0 |
CGN4 | | v3.0 | CGN6 | | v5.0 | CGN8 |

== Which image should I use? == '''Deciding on a filesystem layout'''

Both the SquashFS and JFFS2 filesystems use heavy compression to save
disk (flash) space. The choice of layouts really depends on usage
patterns. At this point, the recommended install is the SquashFS version
which will provide you with failsafe mode and a slightly better
compression ratio than the JFFS2 partitions. Should you feel the need to
switch over to JFFS2 later, the {{{jffs2root}}} script can be run -- the
reverse can't be said.

See \[<http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/00-README> 00-README\].

== How do I install/flash OpenWrt? == '''NOTE:''' Before you install
!OpenWrt make sure you have at least basic GNU/Linux knowledge and \*nix
shell skills.

'''TIP:''' You can flash the White Russian images ({{{\*.bin}}})
directly from the other web interfaces now. It should to be safe even
without {{{boot\_wait=on}}}. But there is no garantee it will work.

See \["OpenWrtDocs/Installing"\].

== Do I need to run firstboot on every boot? == No. {{{firstboot}}} is
for formatting the JFFS2 partition on flash and creating the directory
structure; you only need to run it after upgrading the firmware or if
you like to restore the default filesystem.

'''NOTE:''' The {{{firstboot}}} script doesn't do anything if you're
using one of the JFFS2 only images.

== How do I edit files on the SquashFS image? == '''RC 6''':

No special steps are required to edit files,
\[<http://www.denx.de/wiki/bin/view/Know/MiniFOHome> mini\_fo\] is used
to overlay the SquashFS and JFFS2 partitons.

When a file which is actually located in /rom is modified, it is copied
to /jffs and the changes are actually applied to that file. mini\_fo
will always use the /jffs version of a file over the /rom version, in
order to reclaim wasted space when reverting to the /rom version, you
must delete the file in /jffs

'''RC 5 and earlier''':

By default all files on the SquashFS image are actually symlinks to the
real (readonly) files over on {{{/rom}}}, to edit a file you will need
to delete the symlink and copy the file from {{{/rom}}}.

Example:

{{{ rm /etc/ipkg.conf cp /rom/etc/ipkg.conf /etc/ipkg.conf vi
/etc/ipkg.conf }}} Now you can edit the files with an text editor.

'''NOTE:''' On JFFS2 images you can edit the files like on every other
Linux system.

See \["OpenWrtDocs/Using"\] for details.

== How do I recover / boot in failsafe mode? == See
\["OpenWrtDocs/Troubleshooting"\].

== What TFTP client should I use to flash my Wrt? == In GNU/Linux and
other \*ixes, use the {{{atftp}}} client.

On Windows operating systems use one of the following:

> -   tftpd32 from
>     <http://perso.wanadoo.fr/philippe.jounin/tftpd32.html>
> -   or the \[<http://martybugs.net/wireless/openwrt/flash.cgi> one
>     included with Windows\] (from the CMD console)

== Can I flash the OpenWrt image when I changed the LAN IP? == Linksys
routers are always 192.168.1.1 for the bootloader's TFTP. See
\["OpenWrtDocs/Installing"\] for more information.

== How do I convert a .bin image to .trx to use with mtd? == "You need
to convert the bin (eg. openwrt-wrt54g-squashfs.bin) file to a trx file
before reflashing"

'''WRONG!''' The openwrt-brcm-squashfs.trx is a generic trx file that
will work on any supported broadcom platform. The
openwrt-wrt54g-squashfs.bin is just "bin header +
openwrt-brcm-squashfs.trx', the bin header just contains the firmware
version number and what models the firmware can be loaded on; the bin
header is only used for verification before writing the trx data to the
flash. The mtd utility writes the given file to flash without verifying
it; use one of the openwrt-brcm-squashfs.trx when using mtd. Converting
the openwrt-wrt54g-squashfs.bin file back to a trx is just plain
ignorant.

= Misc = == Where can I find the FAQ? == This is the FAQ; you'd be
amazed at how many people ask where the FAQ is, even after being told
that question is answered in the FAQ itself.

== When should I NOT install OpenWrt? == Please do '''NOT''' install
!OpenWrt if you don't know anything about GNU/Linux and shells.

== How do I change NVRAM settings? == {{{ nvram show nvram get variable
nvram set variable=value nvram commit (to save the changes) }}}
'''TIP:''' Use quotes when you have a list of parameters separated by
space. For example:

{{{ nvram set variable="aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ee aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff" nvram set
vlan25ports="25 26 27 28 29 30" }}} See \["OpenWrtNVRAM"\].

== How to create a NVRAM dump for debugging? == Sometimes it's useful to
have a dump of the NVRAM variables to show them other people for
debugging. This can be done with:

{{{ nvram show 2&gt;&1 | sort | more }}} or even:

{{{ strings /dev/nvram | sort | more }}} {{{sort}}} will sort the list
alphabetically to make it easier to read. Use {{{more}}} to list the
output page by page. You can also save the dump into a text file. Use
{{{&gt; /tmp/nvram-dump.txt}}} instead of {{{more}}}. Then SCP the file
to another computer.

'''NOTE:''' Do '''NOT''' post the dump directly into the IRC channel,
for that use a pastebin service like \[<http://www.pastebin.ca/>
pastebin.ca\] or \[<http://www.pastebin.com/> pastebin.com\]. Only post
the URL on IRC.

== Where should I send bug reports? == Please send reproducible bugs to
our \[<http://dev.openwrt.org/report> ticket system\].

== How do I find out the installed OpenWrt version == Check if you have
a file {{{/etc/banner}}}. Do

{{{ cat /etc/banner }}} and watch for a line like this:

{{{ WHITE RUSSIAN (RC5) -------------------------------}}} If you don't
have that file execute

{{{ busybox 2&gt;&1 | grep -i \^busybox }}} {{{ BusyBox v1.00
(2005.10.10-12:42+0000) multi-call binary }}} Your version is based on
the reported date where !BusyBox has been compiled.

== How do I clean up the NVRAM variables (the safe way)? == If you have
used other firmware in the past you probably have more than 400 NVRAM
variables. Most of these NVRAM variables are not necessary for !OpenWrt.
You can safely delete them with the {{{nvram-clean.sh}}} script and have
a more readable NVRAM dump.

To safely clean up these variables use nbd's NVRAM cleanup script found
at <http://downloads.openwrt.org/people/kaloz/nvram-clean.sh>

{{{ cd /tmp wget
<http://downloads.openwrt.org/people/kaloz/nvram-clean.sh> chmod a+x
/tmp/nvram-clean.sh /tmp/nvram-clean.sh }}} The before and after sizes
will show you how much space was recovered.

The {{{nvram-clean.sh}}} script does not commit the changes to NVRAM so
you will have to do this manually with:

{{{ nvram commit }}} Hint: If you have configured your box in client
mode (doesn't matter if bridged or routed) and defined a
"static\_route", this entry will be deleted by the nvram-clean-script.

== How often can I write on the flash chip? == Flash devices can be
written to, at minimum, anywhere between 100,000 and 1,000,000 times
(according to the manufacturers).

You can check which flash chip you have (at in White Russian) by

{{{ nvram show | grep flash\_type }}} and then you can check the
manufacturer's datasheet. In \["OpenWrtNVRAM"\] it is however stated
that it can be written between 1000 and 10000 times.

== Where can I find packages? == All packages included in the stable
White Russian release can be listed with:

{{{ ipkg list | more }}} A list of installed packages can be displayed
with:

{{{ ipkg list\_installed }}} '''TIP:''' If there are no package
descriptions listed you have to run {{{ipkg update}}}.

> . ipkg list\_installed doesn't exist in Micro version which uses
> ipkg-sh (light version of ipkg).

== Why isn't a package for \_\_\_\_ available? == If using White
Russian, be sure you did check the backports repository and X-Wrt
repository to make sure the package isn't available in either of them.
Then search the forums to see if any users have created the package you
want but it hasn't been added to the official repositories. If you still
haven't found your package, then it may be that nobody has needed that
package yet or that nobody has had time to package it. In such a case,
the options you have are:

> -   Wait until the package becomes available
> -   Package it yourself (using the \[:BuildingPackagesHowTo:OpenWrt
>     SDK\])
> -   Find/Pay someone to package it for you (consider soliciting in the
>     forums)

== How much space is available for the JFFS2 partition? ==

:   -   On systems with a 4 MB flash: roughly 2 MB
    -   On systems with a 8 MB flash: roughly 6 MB

The actual size allocated to the partition will vary slightly depending
on the !OpenWrt build. JFFS2 uses compression, the amount of data that
can be stored on that partition will be higher than the above values.

== How do I reflash / How do I revert back to my previous firmware? ==
Make sure you have set {{{boot\_wait=on}}}. To verify this do:

{{{ nvram get boot\_wait }}} should return {{{on}}}. You can set
{{{boot\_wait=on}}} to on by doing:

{{{ nvram set boot\_wait=on nvram commit }}} When this is done you can
follow the \["OpenWrtDocs/Deinstalling"\] page.

boot\_wait indicates whether or not the boot loader (CFE) should wait
for a tftp transfered firmware before it loads the firmware present on
the ROM. To adjust the length of time the CFE waits for this TFTP
transfer, use the sparsely known wait\_time variable. In example:

{{{ nvram set wait\_time=30 nvram commit }}} This would cause the
boot\_wait period to be 30 seconds, allowing plenty of time for TFTP
transfer. The default varies between models and versions and seems to
range between 1 and 3 seconds.

== Does OpenWrt have a web interface? == '''Yes.''' The {{{default}}}
and {{{pptp}}} optimized images will have the web interface (called
!OpenWrt Administrative Console or webif for short) integrated.

The !OpenWrt web interface is based on a set of shell and awk scripts
and the form processing is done with \[<http://haserl.sourceforge.net/>
haserl\]. It uses the !BusyBox HTTPD server.

There is a new webif now available that offers a much richer set of
features than does the original webif. Called webif\^2\^, it is part of
the X-Wrt project to make OpenWrt more end user friendly. To get
information on webif\^2\^, visit <http://www.x-wrt.org>.

'''TIP:''' You still can configure everything in the pure CLI (command
line interface) too.

== Why is the OpenWrt firmware so bare? == !OpenWrt's design philosophy
is to not lock the user down to a particular set of features but rather
to provide a basic framework which can be endlessly customized through
it's package support and writable JFFS2 filesystem. The firmware itself
contains a minimal "core" filesystem with the intent on giving as much
space as possible to the JFFS2 filesystem; the core provides minimal
functionality while the JFFS2 filesystem allows the user to add software
packages and modify the core scripts. The use of a package system allows
the user to customize the set of features required with regard to
available space, without wasting space on unused features.

As an example, the typical WRT54G contains 4 MB of flash while the
WRT54GS contains 8 MB of flash. The typical firmware is intended to fit
on a WRT54G, leaving 4 MB of flash completely unused on the WRT54GS.
With !OpenWrt, the JFFS2 partition will inherit the extra 4 MB of space,
allowing more packages and thus more features.

== Who maintains OpenWrt? == !OpenWrt is the collaboration of many
people. The two people responsible for the creation are Gerry Rozema
(aka groz) and Mike Baker (aka mbm, or embeem to tivo hacking fans). See
\[<https://dev.openwrt.org/wiki/people>\] for a list of developers:

== How do I access the syslog messages? == Use the {{{logread}}} program
to read syslog messages. Syslog stores the messages in the Wrt's RAM.
When the specified part of the RAM gets full syslog deletes the old
messages.

To log to a remote syslog server use:

{{{ nvram set log\_ipaddr=aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd }}} Replace
{{{aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd}}} with the IP address of your remote syslog server
where you want to log to.

See MiniHowtos for details on remote logging.

== How do I have it do something every YYY seconds/minutes? == !OpenWrt
uses {{{crond}}}. So you have to setup a cronjob like on every Linux
system.

See HowtoEnableCron for details.

== What does /sbin/wifi do? == The {{{/sbin/wifi}}} program reads the
wireless {{{[wl0]()}}} settings from NVRAM and reconfigures the Broadcom
wireless driver ({{{wl.o}}}). This is because the Broadcom wireless
driver wants the NVRAM variables in a special order.

The source code for {{{/sbin/wifi}}} is available in SVN. Browse the
\[<https://dev.openwrt.org/file/branches/whiterussian/openwrt/package/wificonf/wificonf.c>
wificonf.c source\].

== How do I open a WRT54G/WRT54GS? == /!'''WARNING:''' Opening the case
will void your warranty. (If you're running third party firmware you've
already voided the warranty. ;-) )

For the most part Linksys uses a screwless case, although some models
(unspecified as to exactly which ones) do have screws. The blue front
panel holds everything together, occasionally there are screws under the
front two rubber feet. Remove the antennas then pull the blue panel off.
The remaining pieces will then slide apart. See
\[<http://voidmain.is-a-geek.net/redhat/wrt54g_revival.html> pictures\].

The easiest way to open the case is to get a firm grip on one of the
blue legs and one of the grey legs and quickly yank apart. It will take
some force to open the WRT54G for the first time, so be gentle but firm.
Apply enough force, but not too much. If it doesn't come apart check for
screws under the front feet.

== When using the SSH client from OpenWrt, I get the following message:
"no auths methods could be used". == The message {{{no auths methods
could be used}}} is related to the following utilization: {{{dropbear}}}
as SSH client and {{{openssh}}} as {{{sshd}}} server, basically,
activating this option in {{{/etc/ssh/sshd\_config}}} works:

{{{ PasswordAuthentication yes }}} == How to view dhcp leases from shell
? == {{{ cat /tmp/dhcp.leases }}} \#\#
\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#
= Networking = == How do I create a DHCP server? == The
\[<http://thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html> dnsmasq\] program acts as
DNS and DHCP server in !OpenWrt. By default it hands out IP addresses
from

{{{192.168.1.100}}} to {{{192.168.1.250}}}.

To change this you have to set two NVRAM variables.

{{{ nvram set dhcp\_start=&lt;start\_number&gt; nvram set
dhcp\_num=&lt;number\_of\_hosts&gt; nvram commit }}} and restart
{{{dnsmasq}}} with:

{{{ killall -9 dnsmasq; /etc/init.d/S60dnsmasq }}} For more details on
howto configure static IP addresses see \["OpenWrtDocs/dnsmasq"\].

== Where should I put custom firewall rules? == They go into the file
{{{/etc/firewall.user}}}. This file has a few examples in it as well.
Don't forget to rerun the {{{/etc/firewall.user}}} scirpt to activate
your changes.

{{{/etc/firewall.user}}} gets called from the
{{{/etc/init.d/S45firewall}}} script on each reboot.

Since !OpenWrt uses the standard Linux {{{iptables}}} for firewalling a
good starting point for documentation is
<http://www.netfilter.org/documentation/>.

note: RC6 seems has a more easier way of configuring firewall rules.
Instead of editing /etc/firewall.user, you can edit
/etc/config/firewall. This seems to be used by X-wrt as well.

'''TIP:''' If you install {{{qosfw-scripts}}} then it's easier to
configure port forwarding.

== How do I configure QoS aka traffic shaping in OpenWrt? == See
\["MiniHowtos/QoSHowto"\].

== How do I route wireless instead of a bridging LAN and WIFI? == See
\["OpenWrtDocs/WhiteRussian/Configuration"\].

== How do I set the timezone and make it stick between reboots? ==
!OpenWrt stores the timezone in the {{{/etc/TZ}}} file.

'''NOTE:''' Most routers does '''NOT''' have a CMOS hardware clock. That
means you have to sync the time after every reboot.

For details on configuring your timezone see
\["OpenWrtDocs/Configuration"\].

== What is br0? == By default the LAN ports and the wireless interface
are bridged together as the virtual interface {{{br0}}}, allowing the
LAN and wireless to share the same IP range.

== How do I configure MAC address cloning in OpenWrt? == To enable MAC
address cloning in !OpenWrt on the WAN interface you have to set the
{{{wan\_hwaddr}}} NVRAM variable.

{{{ nvram set wan\_hwaddr="aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff" nvram commit }}} After
that reboot your Wrt router.

{{{ reboot }}} Now check the MAC address on the your WAN interface with
the {{{ifconfig}}} command. Your WAN interface should have the MAC
address which you set in the NVRAM variable above.

== How do I enable WEP encryption? == {{{ ifdown wifi nvram set
wl0\_wep=enabled nvram set wl0\_key=1 nvram set
wl0\_key1=deadbeef12345deadbeef12345 ifup wifi /sbin/wifi }}} The WEP
key {{{wl0\_key1}}} must be in '''HEX''' format (allowed HEX digits are
0-9 and a-f lower case). The length of the key must be exact 26 HEX
digits than you have a 128 bit WEP key. Avoid using WEP keys with 00 at
the end, otherwise the driver won't be able to detect the key length
correctly.

To save these settings and have the WEP key set each bootup, save the
changes to NVRAM:

{{{ nvram commit }}} See \["OpenWrtDocs/Configuration"\] for details.

== How do I use WiFi Protected Access (WPA)? == You have to install the
{{{nas}}} package (which provides WPA encryption) if not already done
with:

{{{ ipkg install nas }}} Now set some NVRAM variables:

{{{ nvram set wl0\_akm=psk nvram set wl0\_crypto=tkip nvram set
wl0\_wpa\_psk=&lt;your\_preshared\_key&gt; nvram commit }}} Replace
{{{&lt;your\_preshared\_key&gt;}}} to appropriate.

'''NOTE:''' The length of the {{{wl0\_wpa\_psk}}} NVRAM variable must be
at least 8 chars up to 63 chars.

Start WPA with

{{{ /etc/init.d/S41wpa }}} Check with the {{{ps}}} command if there is a
{{{nas}}} process running. If it's not working try rebooting the router.

For details and howto configure WPA2 or AES encryption see
\["OpenWrtDocs/Configuration"\].

== How can I enable Client Mode? == OpenWrt can be configured as Bridged
Client Mode or Routed Client Mode.

For more details on configuring the Wrt as a wireless client, see
\["OpenWrtDocs/WhiteRussian/ClientMode"\].

== Wireless Distribution System (WDS) / Repeater / Bridge == This is an
ASCII art for what WDS can be useful.

clients to all APs. In client mode this is not possible.

For connection of two AP together, both machines have to be set up.

{{{ nvram set wl0\_lazywds=0 nvram set wl0\_wds=aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff nvram
commit ifup wifi; /sbin/wifi }}} Replace {{{aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff}}} with
the MAC address of the router you would like to connect via WDS. On
WRT54G\_1 set MAC of WRT54G\_2 and on WRT54G\_2 set MAC of WRT54G\_1.

If the other router is running OpenWrt too you can get the MAC address
from output of:

{{{ iwconfig eth1 }}} /!'''IMPORTANT:''' Use the correct
\[:OpenWrtDocs/Configuration\#NetworkInterfaceNames:network interface
name\] for your hardware.

See \["OpenWrtDocs/Configuration"\] for details.

== How do I disable ESSID broadcast? == This can be done easily with

{{{ nvram set wl0\_closed=1 /sbin/wifi }}} To keep the settings over a
reboot run:

{{{ nvram commit }}} == Can I adjust the transmit power? == Yes, but
cranking the power to the maximum won't help you any. You might transmit
farther but the noise level will be higher (and will probably bleed into
the neighbouring channels; that looks like
\[<http://wl500g.info/showthread.php?t=12&page=2> this\] then) and your
recieve sensitivity won't be improved any, limiting your distance. If
you want better range go buy better antennas.

== How do I see which computers are connected and at what signal
strength? == My awk scripting is terrible, but I hacked together a
simple script to see who is connected to my network and at what signal
strength. This is useful for finding the optimal antenna orientation,
too. The response is in dBm's and a less negative number is better. Put
this script in /bin, for example. Notice however that it requires the
non free package wl which must be installed with ipkg with

{{{ ipkg install wl }}}

I called the script scan.sh. Make sure to

{{{ chmod ug+x /bin/scan.sh }}} to make it executable. scan.sh

{{{ \#!/bin/sh for MAC in wl assoclist | cut -d ' ' -f 2 ; do echo -n
'Computer: '; echo -n
cat /tmp/dhcp.leases | awk '{x=toupper(\$0); print x}' | grep \$MAC | cut -d ' ' -f 4;
echo -n ' IP: '; echo -n
cat /tmp/dhcp.leases | awk '{x=toupper(\$0); print x}' | grep \$MAC | cut -d ' ' -f 3;
echo -n ' Signal Strength: ' ; echo -n wl rssi \$MAC | cut -d ' ' -f 3;
echo ' dBm' done }}} I invite someone to clean this script up. Only
tested on White Russian pre-release 6.

A somewhat cleaned up version of scan.sh with added DHCP lease
expiration info:

{{{ \#!/bin/sh for MAC in wl assoclist | awk '{print \$2}' do echo -n
"Computer: grep -i \${MAC} /tmp/dhcp.leases | awk '{print \$4}'"; echo
-n " IP: grep -i \${MAC} /tmp/dhcp.leases | awk '{print \$3}'"; echo -n
" Expires:
grep -i \${MAC} /tmp/dhcp.leases | awk '{print \$1}' | awk '{print strftime("%x %X",\$1)}'"
; echo -n " Signal Strength: wl rssi \$MAC | awk '{print \$3}' dBm" ;
echo " " done }}} == What is the difference between [wl0]()\* and
[wl]()\* variables? == Use the {{{[wl0]()*}}} variables. The
{{{[wl]()*}}} variables are obsolete and unused.

== How do I configure PPPoE for Internet access? == That's easy. Just
set some NVRAM variables and plug your DSL modem into the WAN port.

/!'''IMPORTANT:''' Use the correct
\[:OpenWrtDocs/Configuration\#NetworkInterfaceNames:network interface
name\] for your hardware version in the {{{pppoe\_ifname}}} and
{{{wan\_device}}} NVRAM variables.

{{{ nvram set wan\_ifname=ppp0 nvram set wan\_proto=pppoe nvram set
ppp\_idletime=10 nvram set ppp\_mtu=1492 \# The MTU of your ISP nvram
set ppp\_passwd=&lt;your\_isp\_password&gt; nvram set
ppp\_redialperiod=15 nvram set ppp\_username=&lt;your\_isp\_login&gt;
nvram set pppoe\_ifname=&lt;your\_WAN\_interface\_name&gt; nvram set
wan\_device=&lt;your\_WAN\_interface\_name&gt; nvram commit }}}

/!'''IMPORTANT:''' If your provider only accepts CHAP authentication,
you will also need to add the username and password to
{{{/etc/ppp/chap-secrets}}}. If your password is empty, use two
double-quotes "". {{{ \#USERNAME PROVIDER PASSWORD IPADDRESS
&lt;your\_isp\_login&gt; "" &lt;your\_isp\_password&gt; \* }}}

When done bring up the WAN connection with:

{{{ ifup wan }}} See \["OpenWrtDocs/Configuration"\] for details.

== How do I configure DHCP for internet access? == By default !OpenWrt
will listen on the WAN interface for a another DHCP server in your LAN.
Use this kind of internet access f.e. if you have a cable modem.

When you have configured PPPoE before than set the following NVRAM
variables to activate DHCP on the WAN interface.

{{{ nvram set wan\_ifname=&lt;your\_WAN\_interface\_name&gt; nvram set
wan\_proto=dhcp nvram commit }}} /!'''IMPORTANT:''' Use the correct
\[:OpenWrtDocs/Configuration\#NetworkInterfaceNames:network interface
name\] for your hardware.

When done bring up the WAN connection with:

{{{ ifup wan }}} == How do I configure PPTP for internet access? ==
Install the {{{pptp}}} package via

{{{ ipkg install pptp }}} '''TIP:''' If you have no Internet connection
for installing the package, you can flash the PPTP optimized images
(with preinstalled PPTP packages instead of PPPoE packages) from his
\[<http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/newest/pptp/> download
directory\].

/!'''IMPORTANT:''' Use the correct
\[:OpenWrtDocs/Configuration\#NetworkInterfaceNames:network interface
name\] for your hardware version in the {{{pptp\_ifname}}} NVRAM
variable (for nvram-based config) and uci option device (for uci-based
config). If your provider uses round-robin dns records for VPN server
you may want to hardcode the IP address for the server since the pptp.sh
is unable to add routes for all VPN server IP addresses for now.

For Kamikaze 8.09 edit /etc/config/network {{{ option interface wan
option proto pptp option ipproto dhcp option device eth0.1 option
username "username" option password "secret" option server "10.0.0.0"
option persist 1 }}}

You will need to edit /lib/network/pptp.sh and fix the typo there: {{{
setup\_interface\_pptp() { local config="\$2" local ifname

> config\_get device "\$config" device config\_get ipproto "\$config"
> ipproto

-   config\_get server "\$cfg" server

+ config\_get server "\$config" server }}}

For older releases: Set the following NVRAM variables. {{{ nvram set
wan\_proto=pptp nvram set wan\_ifname=ppp0 nvram set
pptp\_ifname=&lt;your\_WAN\_interface\_name&gt; nvram set
pptp\_proto=static nvram set

interface where your modem is connected to via:

{{{ ifup wan }}} If that does not work, the ip address assigned to the
underlaying ethernet connection might be unable to reach the pptp server
directly. You can check that easily with

{{{ route -n }}} If adding the needed route for the pptp server fixes
your problem, you can use the following dirty trick to automatize it, in
/usr/share/udhcpc/default.script add to the bound case:

{{{ if \[ "\$interface" = "vlan1" \] then route add -host 10.0.0.138 gw
\$(echo \$ip | sed 's/\[0-9\]*.\[0-9\]*\$/0.1/') fi }}} This route
command BTW is the one needed for the austrian ISP
\[<http://inode.at>\].

== iptables -F locks you out of telnet/ssh == The default policy on the
filter table is DROP.

If you want to experiment with iptables while logged in via telnet/ssh,
run the following iptables commands:

{{{ iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT iptables -P
FORWARD ACCEPT}}} == MacBook Pro keeps dropping signal even when near AP
== A "sudo dmesg" on the MacBook reveals:

{{{ ATHR: beacon miss causing loss of connection }}} Adjust the beacon
interval so it is smaller (default is 100):

{{{ wl bi 50 }}} Make it permanent:

{{{ nvram set wl0\_bcn=50 nvram commit }}} Note that this does not
completely fix the problem, it only helps mitigate the impact. It has
been shown to be a bug in OS X 10.4.8 and earlier.

= Development = See also the !OpenWrt \[<http://dev.openwrt.org/>
development center\] website. There you can browse the source code and
send reproducible bugs with the ticket system (in trac).

== Requirements for compiling OpenWrt == If you are not used to a Linux
development environment or not sure how to set it up correctly, then
first check out the
\[:OpenWrtDocs/Development/SetupBuildEnvironmentHowTo: Setup Build
Environment HowTo\].

For compiling !OpenWrt (from SVN or from the tarball, both the White
Russian stable release) you need at least a recent GNU/Linux
distribution and the following programs installed:

{{{ gcc, g++, binutils, patch, bzip2, flex, bison, make, gettext, unzip,
ncurses (libncurses-dev), libz-dev and libc headers -- additional
package dependencies: madwifi: uudecode(sharutils), privoxy: autoconf
pkg-config automake }}} When you get error messages related to libnvram,
upgrade {{{make}}} to version 3.80. If that is not working as expected
patch {{{make}}} 3.80 with the
\[<http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/m/make/make_3.80-9.diff.gz>
Debian make patches\].

Approximately required disc space for compiling OpenWrt: '''Min.''' 1.5
GB ?

Compiling also tested on Windows pc under
\[<http://wiki.gp2x.org/wiki/AndLinux> AndLinux\]
(\[<http://www.colinux.org> coLinux\] + Ubuntu)

== How do I create/compile/build OpenWRT myself? == Check out the
\[:OpenWrtDocs/BuildingKamikazeHowTo: Building Kamikaze HowTo\].

== Where is the subversion (SVN) repository ? == '''Stable Source'''

The stable source code can be found in the above directory or from our
SVN repository. This is not recommended for beginners; we will not
troubleshoot failed compiles.

{{{ svn co
<https://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/branches/whiterussian/openwrt/> }}}
\[<http://dev.openwrt.org/browser/branches/whiterussian/openwrt/>
Browse\] the stable source SVN branch.

'''Development'''

/!'''WARNING:''' Please never use any development image (release images
are safe) of Kamikaze, if you have no access to serial console. The
chance to brick your router with the development version is very high.

Development take place in SVN. You get the source via:

{{{ svn co <https://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/trunk/>}}}
\[<http://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/> Browse\] the development SVN
branch.

/!'''NOTE:''' Development has temporarily moved to the buildroot-ng
branch... for development information, check: <https://dev.openwrt.org>
.

== Should I report bugs releated to the buildroot system == Yes. If you
find any bugs, please use our \[<http://dev.openwrt.org/report> ticket
system\] or send a report to <openwrt-devel@openwrt.org> . You can send
patches for the bugs as well.

/!'''NOTE:''' Changes to the buildroot system or the associated
{{{Makefiles}}} could break the compile process. Please do not submit
bug reports against modified copies of buildroot. Thanks.

== Where is the buildroot documentation? == BuildRoot. Or see
\[<http://downloads.openwrt.org/docs/buildroot-documentation.html>
buildroot documentation\].

== How do I create a package? == See BuildingPackagesHowTo.
