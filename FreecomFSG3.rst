Freecom FSG-3 is Intel XScale based consumer NAS device. '''OpenWrt does NOT currently support this device.''' However, there's XScale port in progress by Kaloz. It's not targeted for FSG-3, but when ready it should be fairly easy to add FSG-3 specific features to it.

== Hardware ==
 * Intel XScale IXP422 at 266MHz with hardware encryption
 * 64MB RAM and 4MB flash
 * Four port Realtek RTL8305SB switch configured as one WAN port and three LAN ports
 * NEC USB 2.0 on PCI-bus. Four external (two front, two back) and one internal (empty pads on PCB)
 * VIA IDE controller on PCI-bus. One external eSATA, one internal PATA. Empty pads on PCB likely for another SATA bus
 * Internal PATA HDD. Various sizes available (80G, 160G, 250G, 400G, 500G)
 * Empty Mini-PCI socket on PCB for WLAN option. Stock firmware supports only Marvell based cards.
 * Power button, Unplug button and Reset button. On PCB there's SYNC button pads
 * Small approx. 3cm * 3cm fan
 * JTAG connector
 * TTL serial connector (another empty pads next to it, maybe second serial port)
 * Winbond environment monitoring chip with three temperature sensors and fan RPM monitoring

== Software ==
FSG-3 uses RedBoot bootloader and runs bigendian SnapGear Linux 3.1.6 based on 2.4.27 kernel. Freecom told they're going to upgrade to 2.6 kernel during 2006.
