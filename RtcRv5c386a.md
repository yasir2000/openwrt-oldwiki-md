The WL-HDD and WL-700gE both integrate a Real Time Clock using a Ricoh
RV5C386A chip over the I2C bus. This chip is not supported out of the
box by OpenWRT, but Asus's source code includes a driver for it, as well
as freely available documentation from Ricoh.

You can download a package, to placed in the ../openwrt/package when
building OpenWRT.

{{{bzr clone <http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~monnier/bzr/rtc-rv5c386a>}}}

This will add a standard /dev/rtc device which you can use with the
usual hwclock utility. There is a Trac
\[<https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/1873> ticket\] to try and get this
included in OpenWRT, which includes some older versions of this package.
There is also an older Trac \[<https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/1749>
ticket\] with even older code for it.
