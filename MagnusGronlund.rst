Been playing with different unices since 1991. Mainly different BSD flavors and that's probably why I like the 
"minimalistic" feel of OpenWrt.
 
Currently I run OpenWrt on a [:MagnusGronlund/DWL-7100AP:DWL-7100AP], a [:OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/D-Link/DSL-G624T:DSL-G624T] and some other routers/APs/NASes.
