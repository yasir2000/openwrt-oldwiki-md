I will be working towards creating a far more structured TableOfHardware as I think the current one could do with some tidying up and adding some taxonomy.

Here is an outline of my proposal:

Divide the current page in to multiple pages based on categories

-----------------------------------------------
List of Categories (not finalized)

SupportedKamikaze
SupportedWhiteRussian
WorkInProgress
NotSupported
NeverSupported

OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Asus/WL500W

----

If anyone else would like to lend a hand that would be great
