This page describes how to build a transparent firewall with 2 VLANs and
"oneway" communication. It builds a simple DMZ on the same subnet as
LAN. Membership to LAN or DMZ is given by the port to which the host is
connected. DMZ cannot connect or ping to LAN nor router. LAN can connect
and ping to DMZ and router.

= Transparent Oneway Switch HowTo or Semipermiable Switch HowTo =

Let's build a certain kind of DMZ:

:   -   anything on the same subnet
    -   hosts in the DMZ must not connect or ping LAN
    -   hosts on LAN must be able to connect and ping hosts on DMZ
    -   gateway to internet is in DMZ
    -   Router is visible from LAN only
    -   no WLAN

= This is how it should look like: =

I use 192.168.1.0/24, because that's the routers defult setting.

{{{ ex.:

> +--------+

> GATEWAY (192.168.1.9) -------------| Port 0 |
>
> :   +--------+
>
> HOST A (192.168.1.111) -----------| Port 1 |
>
> :   +--------+
>
> HOST B (192.168.1.23) -----------| Port 2 |
>
> :   +--------+
>
> HOST C (192.168.1.21) ------------| Port 3 |
>
> :   +--------+ | WAN | ---------- to LAN (192.168.1.xxx) +--------+
>     ROUTER
>
> > (192.168.1.1)

}}}

= Hands on =

OpenWrt White Russian RC6, a WRT54GL v1.1., SQASHFS image.

== Install extra packages == Set up the router so that you've got a
working internet connection with dns. Ssh to the router. You need to
install some extra packages: {{{ <root@OpenWrt>:\~\# ipkg update
<root@OpenWrt>:\~\# ipkg install ebtables <root@OpenWrt>:\~\# ipkg
install kmod-ebtables <root@OpenWrt>:\~\# ipkg install
iptables-mod-extra <root@OpenWrt>:\~\# ipkg install kmod-ipt-extra }}}

if you get an error, you may have to copy /etc/resolv.conf from your
workstation to /tmp/resolv.conf (squashfs) or /etc/resolv.conf (jffs) on
the router: {{{ <root@OpenWrt>:\~\# scp /etc/resolv.conf
<root@192.168.1.1>:/tmp/resolv.conf }}}

== Basic LAN setup == Then delete any IP associated with your WAN.
That's because the bridge will take it over. You may use the
webinterface to do this: \* disable WLAN (if you want to keep it, you'll
need some extra steps) \* set WAN IP 0.0.0.0 \* set WAN gateway = same
as LAN gateway (that's just beautification) \* set WAN netmask = same as
LAN netmask (that's just beautification)

== VLAN setup == Bridgeing is a funny thing on the WRT54. To make things
working you need to turn on vlan tagging on all bridged vlan interfaces
(here on vlan1) but one (vlan0). That's no hard condition. You may tag
all vlans or all but one. But all untagged vlans are handled as one ...
and when you define firewall rules you may go nuts about this.

SSH to your rooter. First take a look at your nvram vars that handle
vlans: {{{ <root@OpenWrt>:\~\# nvram show | grep vlan | sort
lan\_ifnames=vlan0 eth2 vlan0hwname=et0 vlan0ports=3 2 1 0 5\*
vlan1hwname=et0 vlan1ports=4 5t wan\_device=vlan1 wan\_iface=vlan1
wan\_ifname=vlan1 wan\_ifnames=vlan1 }}} and now enable tagging on
vlan1: {{{ <root@OpenWrt>:\~\# nvram set vlan1ports="4 5t" }}}

If you've turned off WLAN, then let's remove it from our bridge. You
must not add vlan1, otherwise you will have to use failsave mode: {{{
<root@OpenWrt>:\~\# nvram set lan\_ifnames=vlan0 }}}

and don't forget to commit the changes: {{{ <root@OpenWrt>:\~\# nvram
commit }}}

Now it's save to reboot your router.

== Bridge == Again, ssh to router. Let's take a look at the bridge: {{{
<root@OpenWrt>:\~\# brctl show bridge name bridge id STP enabled
interfaces br0 8000.001839ceaa72 no vlan0 }}}

Let's add the WAN interface (vlan1) to the bridge: {{{
<root@OpenWrt>:\~\# brctl addif br0 vlan1 <root@OpenWrt>:\~\# brctl show
bridge name bridge id STP enabled interfaces br0 8000.001839ceaa72 no
vlan0 vlan1 }}}

Fine, your router is now a 5 port switch with funny firewall rules :-)

Build a startup script to make the changes persistent. As I was not able
to write any text with OpenWrt vi, I use cat and copy&paste. \^d means
&lt;ctrl&gt;+&lt;d&gt;: {{{ <root@OpenWrt>:\~\# cat &gt;
/etc/init.d/S50mystuff \#!/bin/bash brctl addif br0 vlan1 \^d }}}

Make it executeable: {{{ <root@OpenWrt>:\~\# chmod a+x
/etc/init.d/S50mystuff }}}

And now kick out the builtin firewall: {{{ <root@OpenWrt>:\~\# chmod -x
/etc/init.d/S50firewall }}}

Now reboot the router. And connect your workstation with the WAN port of
the router, as we are going to set up some firewall rules in the next
step.

== Check it == ... ssh to router. Let's take a look at the firewall: {{{
<root@OpenWrt>:\~\# iptables -L -n -v }}}

That's much better. Let's take a look at the bridge: {{{
<root@OpenWrt>:\~\# brctl show bridge name bridge id STP enabled
interfaces br0 8000.001839ceaa72 no vlan0 vlan1 }}} Fine :-)

== Firewall == Now let's build our new Firewall. First you need to load
some modules: {{{ <root@OpenWrt>:\~\# /sbin/insmod ebtables
<root@OpenWrt>:\~\# /sbin/insmod ebtable\_broute <root@OpenWrt>:\~\#
/sbin/insmod ebtable\_filter <root@OpenWrt>:\~\# /sbin/insmod
ebtable\_nat <root@OpenWrt>:\~\# /sbin/insmod ebt\_ip
<root@OpenWrt>:\~\# /sbin/insmod ebt\_snat <root@OpenWrt>:\~\#
/sbin/insmod ipt\_recent.o }}}

Now the rules. First let's drop all new connections to vlan1, then let's
hide the router from the DMZ: {{{ <root@OpenWrt>:\~\# iptables -I
FORWARD -o vlan1 -m state --state NEW -j DROP <root@OpenWrt>:\~\#
iptables -I INPUT -i vlan0 -d \$(nvram get lan\_ipaddr) -j DROP }}}

Let's test it. Connect your workstation into the WAN port, connect some
other computer to a LAN port. From your workstation enter: {{{ ping
&lt;ip of router&gt; }}} {{{ ping &lt;ip of other computer&gt; }}} Both
should work. Now move to other computer and try: {{{ ping &lt;ip of
router&gt; }}} {{{ ping &lt;ip of workstation&gt; }}} None of them
should work :-)

== Finalizing == Put it all togather in a script: {{{
<root@OpenWrt>:\~\# cat &gt; /etc/init.d/S50mystuff \#!/bin/bash brctl
addif br0 vlan1 /sbin/insmod ebtables 2&gt; /dev/null /sbin/insmod
ebtable\_broute 2&gt; /dev/null /sbin/insmod ebtable\_filter 2&gt;
/dev/null /sbin/insmod ebtable\_nat 2&gt; /dev/null /sbin/insmod ebt\_ip
2&gt; /dev/null /sbin/insmod ebt\_snat 2&gt; /dev/null /sbin/insmod
ipt\_recent.o 2&gt; /dev/null iptables -I FORWARD -o vlan1 -m state
--state NEW -j DROP iptables -I INPUT -i vlan0 -d \$(nvram get
lan\_ipaddr) -j DROP \^d }}}

Reboot the router, check again.

If you have windows(tm) computers running on both vlans and you want to
make NetBEUI name resolution working (i.e. see all computers in network
neighbourhood) then you can add these 2 lines:

{{{ iptables -I FORWARD -p udp --sport 137:138 -j ACCEPT iptables -I
FORWARD -p udp --dport 137:138 -j ACCEPT }}}

not perfect, but working.

== ... and back again == As it is now, your router is a switch with
oneway connections. It acts much like a semipermiable membrane. It
forbids connections from DMZ to LAN on the same subnet, but allows them
from LAN to DMZ. There are lots of ways to improve. The firewall is
primitive. You can add mor vlans. You can add WLAN ...

... use your imagination :-D
