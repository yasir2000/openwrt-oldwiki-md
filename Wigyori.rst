Unix admin located in Budapest, Hungary, working for a large telco company. Contributing to OpenWrt a few times - at least for soldering Kaloz's stuff, writing smaller patches -, also playing with AVR32 and SuperH-based embedded stuff. Short range plans include an X.org 7.2 compiled with uClibc, mostly for OpenWrt and OpenMoko.
