The RDC port is a port of OpenWrt to the RDC R3211 SoC. This is a x86 compatible chip. Devices that use this chipset are:

   * Airlink 101 AR525W
   * Edimax BR-6216Mg
   * Gemtek WRTR-137G
   * Longshine LCS-WR-2114M
   * Sitecom WL-153

== Status ==

RDC support was started in October 2006 in the Kamikaze branch and is regarded unstable.

== Hardware differences ==

The Sitecom WL-153, Longshine  LCS-WR-2114M and Edimax BR-6216Mg (and other devices which are simply rebranded Edimax devices) seem to be equiped with just 2 MB of flash (Macronix 29LV160CBTC-70G chip) and 16 MB RAM. Other devices apparently have 4 MB flash.
