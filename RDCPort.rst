The RDC port is a port of OpenWrt to the RDC R321x(-G) and R861x(-G) SoC's. These are x86-compatible chips. The "86" in the designation represents the industrial version, while "32" represents the commercial version. The last digit is "0" for ones with USB, and "1" for ones without. RDC's website had a datasheet each for the R8610 and the R8610-G, but they have been removed. Most info there applied to the aforementioned derivatives the way one would expect. Devices that use this chipset include:

   * Airlink 101 AR525W
   * Edimax BR-6216Mg
   * Gemtek WRTR-137G
   * Longshine LCS-WR-2114M
   * Sitecom WL-153
   * Sitecom WL-176

== Status ==

The RDC support was started in October 2006 in the Kamikaze branch and is now considered stable with squashfs images.
== TODO ==

Make GPIO work more fully on this device. Upgrade rt61 wireless driver to use the dscape version.
Fix JFFS2 images.

== Hardware differences ==

The Sitecom WL-153, Longshine  LCS-WR-2114M and Edimax BR-6216Mg (and other devices which are simply rebranded Edimax devices) seem to be equiped with just 2 MB of flash (Macronix 29LV160CBTC-70G chip) and 16 MB RAM. Other devices apparently have 4 MB flash.
