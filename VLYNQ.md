VLYNQ is the name of a proprietary interface developed by Texas
Instruments. It's used for TI's broadband products, such as modems and
WLAN, voice broadband processors, digital media processors, and OMAP
media processor chips. The ACX111 WLAN cards used in AR7 devices look
like mini-PCI, but actually they are dual mode cards, that talk both,
mini-PCI and VLYNQ.
