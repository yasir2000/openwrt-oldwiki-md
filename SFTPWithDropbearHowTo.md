\[\[TableOfContents\]\] = Introduction = This HOWTO explains how to
configure SFTP for use with the Dropbear SSH package. Dropbear is
typically used because of its small size. It is pre-installed on
!OpenWrt.

== What is SFTP? == Secure File Transfer Protocol or SFTP is a protocol
that was incorporated as part of SSH. The idea behind SFTP is to have
all of the features that FTP has, but transfer both passwords and file
data over an encrypted link.

=== Do You Really Need To Switch to SFTP? === If you happen to come to
this webpage only to solve your problems with WinSCP, groups listing and
{{{--full-time}}} , be aware that you don't need the following. Instead,
\[<http://winscp.net/eng/docs/ui_login_scp#directory_listing> change the
settings inside WinSCP\]. Briefly:

> -   turn on Advanced options checkbox in bottom left part of Login
>     dialog in order to see "Environment/SCP"
>
> \* Session/Protocol:
>
> :   -   SCP mode
>
> \* Environment/SCP:
>
> :   -   uncheck Lookup user groups
>     -   uncheck Try to get full timestamp
>     -   uncheck Alias LS to display group name

= Activating Dropbear = Dropbear is a small SSH daemon that comes
pre-installed on !OpenWrt. However, it is not active by default. To
activate Dropbear, change the password. You can do this on the web
interface, or use the shell command:

{{{ passwd}}}

You will be prompted for a new {{{root}}} password, along with a
verification prompt. Once this is done, !OpenWrt will disable the telnet
daemon and activate the Dropbear SSH daemon.

= Installing the SFTP module = Update the package list and install the
''openssh-sftp-server'' package. You can do this on the web interface,
using ''System'' - ''Installed Software'', ''Update package lists'',
then ''Install'' the ''openssh-sftp-server'' package. Or use the shell
prompt:

{{{ ipkg update ipkg install openssh-sftp-server}}}

= Windows SFTP clients = Once both SSH and SFTP are installed you will
be able to securely access the routers files via a secure connection.
Two of the most popular clients that support SFTP are the
\[<http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/> Putty SFTP
client\] and the \[<http://filezilla.sourceforge.net/> FileZilla\]
graphical client. While the !FileZilla client is actually built upon the
Putty client they will be treated here as if they are two distinct
clients.

== FileZilla == The !FileZilla client is an ideal choice for most
Windows users. The graphical interface and relatively small learning
curve allows the user to begin actively using the software immediately.

See the \[<http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=21558>
download page\] and the \[<http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=21558>
user’s forum\].

== Putty SFTP == Called PSFTP the Putty SFTP client is a robust and
stable implementation of the secure file transfer protocol. While good,
Putty's client is command-line based. If you are used to graphical
clients, use !FileZilla instead.

See Putty's
\[<http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html>
download page\] and Putty's
\[<http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/docs.html>
documentation page\].

== WinSCP == WinSCP is a Windows program that makes use of code from
Simon Tatham's "Putty". It provides a GUI and can be either installed or
run from a stand-alone exe without installation.

WinSCP has a shell extension, which is only available if the software is
installed on the client machine, that will allow drag-and-drop usability
from the WinSCP window to almost any other Explorer windows. For
example, one could drag firewall.conf straight to the desktop.

However, if the non-installation method is chosen, e.g., it is run
solely from the exe, then drag-and-drop capabilities will be restricted
to within the WinSCP window only. The WinSCP windows can provide an
interface either like Norton Comander (r) or like Windows (r) Explorer.

The software is free and open-source. You can download it
\[<http://winscp.net/eng/download.php> here\] or visit the
\[<http://winscp.net/eng/index.php> home page\].
