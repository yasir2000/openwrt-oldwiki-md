== Compiling under Cygwin == This is still a work in progress. To date,
I do not believe that the complete image has been build under Cygwin. I
can get past the toolchain build, so that you can cross-compile your
programs.

=== Setup cygwin ===

:   -   Obviously we need \[<http://www.cygwin.com/> Cygwin\]. Required
        packages are at least tar, sed, flex, gcc, vim, wget, unzip,
        ncurses-devel, perl, patch and make.
    -   In Cygwin, make sure that /bin or /usr/bin comes before Windows.
        This defaults for some, not for others. You can verify this with
        "which find":

{{{ \$ which find /usr/bin/find }}} If you get Windows find, then you
have to change the path. You can do this inside Cygwin, but your changes
will be temporary: just type {{{ \$ export PATH=/usr/bin/:\$PATH }}} Now
if you "echo \$PATH" you should get /usr/bin/: as the first of a list of
colon-separated directories.

> -   Right-click on "My Computer" and go to Properties, then Advanced,
>     and click "Environment Variables". On the bottom window, "System
>     Variables", find "PATH". Click "Edit" and add your cygwin bin
>     directory, by default C:cygwinbin, to the beginning of the path,
>     remembering to add a semicolon after the path.

=== What else do we need ===

{{{ cd \~ wget
<http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/newest/whiterussian_rc4.tar.bz2>
tar -xvjf whiterussian\_rc4.tar.bz2 }}}

> -   A really up to date make version:
>     \[<ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/make/> Make 3.81 Beta 4\]

{{{ cd \~ wget <ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/make/make-3.81beta4.tar.bz2> tar
-xvjf make-3.81beta4.tar.bz2

cd make-3.81beta4 ./configure make make install cp make.exe /usr/bin cd
\~ }}}

> \* Some updated header files.

You can get these from either a Linux machine that has/can compile
OpenWrt, or you can grab them from Nate True's website
\[<http://devices.natetrue.com/openwrt/cygwin-include-x86.zip>\]. Note
that these files are likely to need to be from a system of the same CPU
type. The ones on Nate True's site are for the Intel x86 32-bit or
compatible architecture.

{{{ cd \~ wget
<http://devices.natetrue.com/openwrt/cygwin-include-x86.zip> cd
/usr/include unzip \~/cygwin-include-x86.zip cd \~ }}}

=== Compiling ===

==== Start the configuration ==== {{{ \$ make menuconfig }}} Leave all
defaults and save the configuration to the default file.

==== Start compiling ==== {{{ \$ make }}}

If make shows a tar error relating to wildcards, you need to edit
openwrt/rules.mk

Find this section:

{{{

:   ifeq (\$(BR2\_TAR\_VERBOSITY),y) TAR\_OPTIONS=-xvf else
    TAR\_OPTIONS=-xf endif

}}}

Add "--wildcards" to two lines, as shown below.

{{{

:   ifeq (\$(BR2\_TAR\_VERBOSITY),y) TAR\_OPTIONS=--wildcards -xvf else
    TAR\_OPTIONS=--wildcards -xf endif

}}}

If it fails with a message to the effect of "symbol \_bfd\_mips\_arch
not found, referenced in archures.c" -make sure there are no DOS CR
characters (\^M) in the source files (that includes .patch files,
Makefiles,etc.), then

{{{find . -exec grep -l -L \^M '{}' ;}}}

is your friend (where \^M is produced in Cygwin shell by doing Ctrl-V
Ctrl-J). If this finds anything run {{{dos2unix}}} on the files it
found.

-   It failed after building the cross compiler, while building the
    debugger. If this is all you need.. fine. I'm going for gold. It
    fails because it expects gdb to be called gdb, instead it's called
    gdb.exe. To fix this, edit openwrt/toolchain/gdb/Makefile

{{{ \$ vi \~/openwrt/toolchain/gdb/Makefile }}}

Here's the problem area:

{{{

:   45 \$(GDB\_CLIENT\_DIR)/gdb/gdb: \$(GDB\_CLIENT\_DIR)/.configured 46
    \$(MAKE) -C \$(GDB\_CLIENT\_DIR) 47 strip
    \$(GDB\_CLIENT\_DIR)/gdb/gdb 48

}}}

Change line 47, adding ".exe" to the end:

{{{

:   45 \$(GDB\_CLIENT\_DIR)/gdb/gdb: \$(GDB\_CLIENT\_DIR)/.configured 46
    \$(MAKE) -C \$(GDB\_CLIENT\_DIR) 47 strip
    \$(GDB\_CLIENT\_DIR)/gdb/gdb.exe 48

}}}

This will get you past the GDB, and it'll fail while patching the LZMA
files.

==== Patching ====

{{{ \# patch -d /home/Yasha/openwrt/build\_mipsel/lzma -p1 &lt;
lzma-406-zlib-stream.patch \# patching file
SRC/7zip/Compress/LZMA/LZMADecoder.cpp \# Hunk \#1 FAILED at 288. }}}

Eagle\_Fire got it to work by manually applying the patch, and editing
the makefile to remove the automatic patching. I got it to work a
different way.

I was manually applying the patch, and noticed \^M's at the end of the
patch file. tojoe on IRC told me that they were misinterpreted
linebreaks, and dos2unix fixed that. I ran: {{{ \$ dos2unix
target/lzma/lzma-406-zlib-stream.patch
target/lzma/lzma-406-zlib-stream.patch: done. }}}

and the patching worked. Thanks tojoie!

The same patching must also be done to the following two files, at
least:

{{{ \$ dos2unix
target/linux/linux-2.4/patches/generic/105-netfilter\_TTL.patch
target/linux/linux-2.4/patches/generic/105-netfilter\_TTL.patch: done.

\$ dos2unix target/linux/linux-2.4/patches/generic/000-linux\_mips.patch
target/linux/linux-2.4/patches/generic/000-linux\_mips.patch: done. }}}

Or just use: {{{ target/linux/linux-2.4/patches/generic/\*.patch }}}

==== Patching the patches ====

Then the patches need to be patched. Yes! This is because the file
ipt\_CONNMARK.c is the same ipt\_connmark.c under windows, but not under
Linux. I did this with vi for "105-netfilter\_TTL.patch" with {{{
:1,\$s/ipt\_TTL./ipt\_TTL\_target./gIc }}}

And for "112-netfilter\_connmark.patch" with {{{
:1,\$s/ipt\_CONNMARK./ipt\_CONNMARK\_target./gIc
:1,\$s/ipt\_TTL.o/ipt\_TTL\_target.o/gIc }}}

That brought me through the patching. (Maybe - i can't remember if not -
see below)

BUT the error is caused for more files because there are more of them
having the same name in uppercase and lowercase. So an unpack script is
needed to unpack "linux-2.4.30.tar.bz2" to give these files an differnt
name. Then this script needs to be injected into the existing Makefiles.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've written an makefile that does the most oft the patching. Some of
the Makefiles need to be patched too. It's not tested for correct
handling with directorys (may not work when openwrt tar is unpacked into
a different directory, but it should). And, against my hope there are
some include files from real linuxes needed for compilation. So i need
someone with some time to test this, having an real linux available for
bringing this hole thing to end.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

That's all I have so far. If you have any ideas, find Flyashi on
\#openwrt. I'd appreciate the help... thanks!

Oh and HUGE thanks to Eagle\_Fire for most of these insructions! And
tojoe for the patch file fix. Thanks guys!

==== note on dd and text mode files under Cygwin ==== Cygwin is prone to
"fixing" CR/LF line ends when a file is opened in text mode. Utilities
can do this unexpectedly,
\[<http://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2005-05/msg00786.html> (ref)\],
especially if you have a text-mode mount point. In particular dd behaves
this way, and this can nip you, e.g. when you follow the instructions
for restoring \["OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Netgear/WGT634U"\] original
firmware. Cygwin
\[<http://www.sourceware.org/ml/cygwin-announce/2006-01/msg00019.html>
coreutils release 5.93-2\] added dd command-line options iflag=binary,
oflag=binary to control this. Last I checked, these options are
documented in dd --help but not in the dd man page.
