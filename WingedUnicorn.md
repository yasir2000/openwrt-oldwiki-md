the forum.

== madwifi-0.9.3.3 == <attachment:madwifi-ar2316.patch>

This is just a quick hack - Di624 lacks boardconfig on flash, so this
code is used to assemble one on the fly. It uses dummy mac address
00:00:11:11:11:11, so is more like a reference, not a proposed patch.

I build it with the following shell script: {{{ export
CROSS\_COMPILE=mips-linux-d=/pub k=/root/di/di624/kernels/ar231x make -j
3 TARGET=ap51 KERNELPATH=\$k DESTDIR=\$d BUS=AHB all make TARGET=ap51
KERNELPATH=\$k DESTDIR=\$d BUS=AHB install }}}

== ecos-2.0 (for redboot) == <attachment:ecos-patch-ar2316.patch>

I need to be able to upload original firmware at any time. Thus, i left
untouched original loader and backup firmware. I use original loader to
load redboot code as if it was just a primary firmware. Thus i have
quite an odd memory layout for redboot: it's neither ROM, RAM or ROMRAM.
It's like RAM, but requires some initialization from ROM, but not like
ROMRAM, because no need to copy to RAM (original loader already did
that). So, i just go ahead and hack startup code and ld scripts for ROM
model. Here is the \[<attachment:mkimg.pl> perl script\] to build
firmware images compatible with original loader.

=== mvPhy port trailer support for ae531x driver ===
<attachment:eth-mvphy-vlan-traler-ar2316.patch>

When mvPhy is built with CONFIG\_VENETDEV option, packets that go out
throug port5 (MAC) are appended with 4-byte trailer which identity the
originating port. Same for packets that came from port5 - mvPhy strips
last 4 bytes and depending on the value may override default frame
routing. This patch adds support for "hw accelerated" vlan feature to
ae531x driver: it tags packets that came from port0..port3 as vlan1 and
port4 as vlan2. Similar for outgoing packets. This is very limited and
non-flexible functionality, but thats enough to build 4lan/1wan port
router.

This patch fixes a bug with load avg always &gt;= 1: original code
creates a daemon thread during eth device open (ifconfig up). It does
not reparentize or daemonize new thread, thus 'ifconfig eth0 up' process
remains in status "D" (non interruptible sleep) in ps forever. In linux,
non-interruptible wait is accounted as 100% cpu usage during load avg
calculations, so this is all kind of weird. I've changed the logic, so
the same daemon thread appeared as normal kernel daemon process sleeping
in interruptable sleep but ingnoring all signals. Yet, again, it is not
stopped during device close and could be started again during next
ifconfig up. So, it's not the best fix ever :)

=== ar2316 arch support === <attachment:arch-ar2316.patch>

adds MIPS32 4KecR2 processor id support. without this code kernel lacks
wait instruction, thus wasting power on heating the air.

=== mtd patch for my flash layout === <attachment:mtd-ar2316.patch>

this is my personal flash layout. you may hack this file to use your
own. I've tried to use redboot fis partition parser code, but it seems
to be broken and i was not in mood to fix it.

just a braindump/research results. It can only be used as a reference by
someone who have enough time and will to add support for this platform
