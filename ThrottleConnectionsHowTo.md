This page describes how to throttle incoming connections. (Updated to
Kamikaze 7.09 on 2008-01-11)

You might want to do this if you are running a server on your OpenWRT
box which is open to the internet. For example, if you have a SSH server
you will find that your syslog is filled with this type of behaviour:

{{{ 12:45:40 dropbear\[9840\]: bad password attempt for 'root' from
212.180.4.152:36250 12:45:41 dropbear\[9840\]: exit before auth (user
'root', 1 fails): Disconnect received 12:45:41 dropbear\[9843\]: Child
connection from 212.180.4.152:36444 12:45:44 dropbear\[9843\]: bad
password attempt for 'root' from 212.180.4.152:36444 12:45:45
dropbear\[9843\]: exit before auth (user 'root', 1 fails): Disconnect
received 12:45:45 dropbear\[9844\]: Child connection from
212.180.4.152:36636}}} Which is kind of annoying.

Here's how to use \[<http://snowman.net/projects/ipt_recent/>
mod\_recent\] to restrict incoming connections to a certain number
within a certain time. The example below assumes you want to restrict
incoming SSH connections to 5 connections per 180 seconds. This document
is based on the information of the document \["OpenWrtDocs/IPTables"\]
and the FAQs at <http://netfilter.org/>.

== Installing on White Russian and versions before Kamikaze 7.07 ==
Firstly, install the kernel packages. For versions before Kamikaze 7.07
you need:

{{{ \# ipkg install kmod-ipt-extra \# ipkg install iptables-mod-extra
}}}

The module "ipt\_recent" must be loaded at every startup, so make sure
that the line {{{ipt\_recent}}} is in {{{/etc/modules}}}. Otherwise add
it via

{{{ \# echo "ipt\_recent" &gt;&gt; /etc/modules }}} To start it manually
without rebooting use

{{{ \# insmod ipt\_recent.o }}}

== Installing on Kamikaze 7.07 and versions before 8.09\_RC1 == For
Kamikaze 7.07 and versions before 9.09\_RC1 you need these packages
instead: {{{ \# ipkg install kmod-ipt-conntrack \# ipkg install
iptables-mod-conntrack }}}

ipt\_recent will automatically be loaded so no further work is needed.

== Installing on Kamikaze 8.09\_RC1 or later == For Kamikaze 8.09\_RC1
or later you need these packages instead: {{{ \# opkg install
kmod-ipt-conntrack \# opkg install kmod-ipt-conntrack-extra \# opkg
install iptables-mod-conntrack \# opkg install
iptables-mod-conntrack-extra }}}

ipt\_recent will automatically be loaded so no further work is needed.

== Configuration ==

Now add the appropriate rules to the file {{{/etc/firewall.user}}}.
Modify your existing rules for SSH connections. Ensure that the new
filter rules replace the existing rule to ACCEPT connections.

{{{ \#\#\# SSH (Dropbear running on port 22) \#\# SSH: Rules for new
incoming connections on tcp-22 iptables -t nat -A prerouting\_wan -p tcp
--dport 22 -m state --state NEW
 -m recent --name ATTACKER\_SSH --rsource --update --seconds 180
--hitcount 5 -j DROP iptables -t nat -A prerouting\_wan -p tcp --dport
22 -m state --state NEW
 -m recent --name ATTACKER\_SSH --rsource --set \#\# SSH iptables -A
input\_wan -p tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT}}}

Test it by logging in 5 times yourself:

{{{ \~ \$ ssh wrt54gs BusyBox v1.00 (2005.09.14-15:55+0000) Built-in
shell (ash) Enter 'help' for a list of built-in commands. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_

wrt54gs port 22: Connection timed out \~ \$}}}

Also have a look at \[<http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=7493>
this forum thread\] where the use of ipt\_recent is discussed. It also
provides an example how to access SSH via a non-standard port (e.g. 443
for restrictive firewalls) although SSH is still running on the standard
port 22.
