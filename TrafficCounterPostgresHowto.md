This HOWTO describes a simple way to count network traffic passing
through an OpenWRT box using an external PostgreSQL database.

You might want to log traffic usage on different interfaces on a OpenWRT
router, or to create IP accounting, but storing the logs directly on the
flash memory is not the best idea. One way to avoid writing anything to
flash during logging is to use an external database. Using this document
you can implement this using PostgreSQL.

The examples here only counts forwarded traffic, but with a minor
changes can be made to count all traffic.

This is for WhiteRussian 0.9.

= PostgreSQL configuration = == Configuration == You need to create a
database, a user that can read and write to the database and enable
access for this user from the router. To achieve this, as the postgres
database superuser (postgres on most systems) execute {{{createuser -E
-P traffic createdb -O traffic traffic}}} This will ask you for a
password for the user. Use something more complex, longer than 12
characters is recommended. You won't need to enter this password after
the installation is complete, so entering one as complex as possible is
not a problem.

To enable connection with that user from your OpenWRT box, you need to
edit your pg\_hba.conf and add {{{ host traffic traffic 192.168.1.1/32
md5 }}} where you need to replace 192.168.1.1 with your OpenWRT box IP.
You also need to make your PostgreSQL to listen on the network interface
where your OpenWRT box is. You can enable listening on all interfaces by
changing listen\_addresses in postgresql.conf to '\*', or adding your
PostgreSQL box IP (e.g. 192.168.1.100) to it. {{{ listen\_addresses =
'localhost, 192.168.1.100' }}}

You need to take the appropriate security preoccasions. Don't forward
traffic from the Internet to the PostgreSQL port on 192.168.1.100 unless
you need it, or filter it, if needed. Don't enable listening on public
addresses, without appropriate filtering, and if you are paranoid,
filter all connections besides those originating on your lo interface
and from your OpenWRT box.

== Database and tables ==

Now you have to create the tables and functions in the database. First
connect to the database as a superuser {{psql traffic}} You need to
create the plpgsql language. You must do this as the database superuser.
Everything else can be done from the traffic user as well. In your psql
shell enter the command {{{CREATE LANGUAGE "plpgsql";}}}

Now to create the tables and functions, either paste the table code
below in the shell, or save it to a file named traffic\_counter.sql in
your current directory and enter {{{i traffic\_counter.sql}}}

The table code:

}}} == Adding iptables rules == Now you need to add iptables rules to
your database. They are not saved on your OpenWRT box. This consists of
two parts — first you need to create named counters in the counters
table, then to add as many as you like rules to the rules table. The
rules are specified as text arguments to the iptables command, so you
are free to create any rules you like. There are seperate columns to
specify the chain and the target. If the chain is NULL, the rules are
added to the forwarding\_traffic chain.

Here is a simple example for counting the traffic on your WAN interface:

{{{ INSERT INTO counters (counter\_name) VALUES ('wan\_in'); INSERT INTO
counters (counter\_name) VALUES ('wan\_out'); SELECT add\_rule
('wan\_in', NULL, NULL, '-i vlan1', 0); SELECT add\_rule ('wan\_out',
NULL, NULL, '-o vlan1', 0); }}} == Optional cron jobs == If you don't
want to keep detailed traffic logs for years in the past, you can the
following to your postgres superuser crontab (if he can connect to the
database without password, either via .pgpass or ident sameuser in
pg\_hba.conf), or to another user having write permissions to the
traffic database. {{{ \# Combine the rules from the hour two days ago
into one 0 \* \* \* \* echo "select purge\_details ('hour', '2 days');"
| psql traffic &gt; /dev/null \# Combine the rules from the day three
months ago into one 0 0 \* \* \* echo "select purge\_details ('day', '3
months');" | psql traffic &gt; /dev/null \# Combine the rules from the
month two years ago into one 0 0 1 \* \* echo "select purge\_details
('month', '2 years');" | psql traffic &gt; /dev/null }}} = OpenWRT box
configuration = You need to enable cron on your OpenWRT box. Time
synchronization is recommended, but it's not needed, as time keeping is
done by the PostgreSQL server. You have to create 'forwarding\_traffic'
chain in iptables, and to add a rule that sends (all) packets passing
through the FORWARD chain there. It might be before or after dropping
INVALID packets, depending on your desires, my choice was before. This
means correctly counting incoming forwarded packets, but not outgoing.

You need to install PostgreSQL console client and zlib. {{{ ipkg install
pgsql-cli ipkg install zlib }}}

You can add the following to your /etc/firewall.user {{{ iptables -N
forwarding\_traffic 2&gt; /dev/null iptables -F forwarding\_traffic
iptables -I FORWARD -j forwarding\_traffic }}}

Now you need scripts to create the counters and collect them. Create a
directory /usr/lib/traffic. Create /usr/lib/traffic/parse\_tables.awk
with the following contents. {{{ BEGIN { j = 1 }

/\^ \*\[0-9\]+ +\[0-9\]+/ {

:   print "INSERT INTO harvests (rid, packets, bytes) SELECT rid, "\$1",
    "\$2" FROM active\_rules WHERE (chain,rulenum) =
    ('"chain"',"j++");";

}

}}} (The above code fragment is in the public domain.)

Then create executable /usr/lib/collect\_traffic.sh with the following
contents. {{{ \#!/bin/sh \# Copyright (C) 2007 Milko Krachounov

export PGPASSWORD=MyVewyVewyObscuredPassword

\# First we check if the traffic counter is initialised if ( ! \[ -f

/usr/lib/traffic/parse\_tables.awk done echo 'END;' ) | psql -A -t -h
"\$DATABASE\_HOST" -U traffic traffic &gt; /dev/null fi

}}}

Replace the DATABASE\_HOST and PGPASSWORD with your PostgreSQL host and
PostgreSQL password. The .pgpass file is not supported in OpenWRT, at
least I couldn't get it to work, so we need to specify the password this
way. Don't forget to run {{{chmod +x /usr/lib/collect\_traffic.sh}}}.

Now all you need to do is to add the above to your cron, running every
5, 15 or 30 minutes.

Run {{{crontab -e}}} and add {{{*/5* \* \* \*
/usr/lib/traffic/collect\_traffic.sh}}}

Voila.

You can reload the rules with {{{/usr/lib/traffic/parse\_tables.sh
reload}}}

= Usage ideas = You get two tables with detailed traffic info and with
summarized month info. You can make use of both for your needs. == Get
the information == You can query the database to get the results for a
period you need. You can get all the traffic that passed through the
rules with {{{ SELECT counter\_name, SUM(bytes) FROM counters LEFT JOIN
harvests USING (rid) GROUP BY counter\_name; }}} You can get the traffic
info for a specific period of one day with {{{ SELECT counter\_name,
SUM(bytes) FROM counters LEFT JOIN harvests USING (rid) WHERE ts &gt;=
timestamp '2007-09-07' AND ts &lt; timestamp '2007-09-08' GROUP BY
counter\_name; }}} You can get the summarized month info by issuing {{{
SELECT counter\_name, year | month as m, bytes FROM counters LEFT JOIN
summarized USING (rid) ORDER BY m; }}} == Automatically turn off after a
threshold == If you have traffic limits on your ISP, you can make your
router turn your internet off automatically after a certain threshold
with scripts.
