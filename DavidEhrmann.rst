= What I'm doing here =
I've been a little frustrated with the both sparse and unorganized documentation here, for a while, so I'm going to try to slowly clean it up.
= My devices =
  * [:OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Linksys/WRT54GL:Linksys WRT54GL]
  * [:OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Netgear/DG834G: Netgear DG834]
  * [:OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Netgear/WGT634UNetgear: WGT634U]
  * Some PCEngines board.  I can't remember which one.

= Wiki! =
I'm not sure what it should ultimately look like, but there are a few problems I'm trying to address, like somewhat duplicated howtos, missing category tags, and painfully out of date pages.  Probably one of the biggest observations is that pages listing add-on packages and modifications are best left to categories.  Pages listing just a few modifications quickly become a dumping ground for links to others--even basic configuration pages collect links useful to only a handful of users.

I'd like a structure somewhat like this:

* OpenWrtDocs/
    * Kamikaze/
      * Pages specific to Kamikaze
    * WhiteRussian/
      * Pages specific to White Russian
    * Hardware/
      * <manufacturer>/
        * Model-specific pages
      * Customizations/
    * Packages/
      * <package name>: package documentation
    * Installation
    * Upgrading
    * Removing

But it's still changing...

= A few external links =
  * [http://s3mp.org s3mp]: My Amazon S3-based mp3 player.  Extra pre-beta.
  * [http://knol.google.com/k/knol/system/knol/pages/Search?nodeId=1aqx1s1xle2uu.0 My Knols]: Mostly focused on technical things.  Some java, some netowrking, some math.  Random stuff, really.
