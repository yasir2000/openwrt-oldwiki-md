I'm using OpenWRT in a couple of Buffalo routers, a Motorola WR850G, and
am finally toying with it on a couple of Router Board 133c's.

The Buffalo routers are nice, and easy to work with.

The Motorola WR850G is ''evil''.

I have a V2 board, which came stock with an amazing 32 MB of RAM. Sweet,
I know. The amount of memory is the only good thing about it, really.

After FINALLY being able to downgrade to Motorola's 4.03, I was able to
set BOOT\_WAIT, which made the rest of my pain a lot easier to bear.

Kamakaze 8.09 RC1 doesn't want to run on it - it TFTPs just fine
(usually, this router has some random TFTP badness which causes it to
fail), supposedly flashes, but refuses to boot. It just sits there, very
brick-like, and altogether uninteresting.

No serial port, so no debugging.

After a good 4 hours or so of messing around, I was finally able to load
7.09, which DID work. I'm not messing with this router any more.

HOT TIP: Don't buy this router unless you're into pain. Really.

I'll update as work progresses.
