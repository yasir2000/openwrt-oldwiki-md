DOCUMENTATION ON THE FORUM. \#\# I DO NOT WANT TO HAVE TO LOCK DOWN
EDITS ON THESE PAGES \#\# - mbm \#\# \#\# (no, don't reply here, use the
forum) \#\# \#\# \#\#\# 2 problems with the above: \#\#\# \#\#\# 1: I
apologize but there seems to be no place and no link to anywhere
appropriate \#\#\# for questions/problems with the wiki itself. I
suggest right on the front page, \#\#\# however small and out of the way
and low contrast, there needs to be \_[something]() \#\#\# for
contacting the wiki or site admins. \#\#\# \#\#\# 2: For example, the
instigation of \#1: \#\#\# The recover lost password procedure does not
work. \#\#\# It emails you your login name and an encrypted password in
a format {SHA}... \#\#\# and tells you to past that password into the
login password field. \#\#\# This does not work. Luckily I was able
eventually to simply remember/guess \#\#\# my password the normal way.
\#\#\# As unwelcome as this comment may be in the front page, I figure
it's better than \#\#\# simply creating a (visible) link to a new page,
which is what I probably should \#\#\# do by rights, and allow the
natural process of everyone revising that take its course. \#\#\#
Another reasonable approach would have been to create a new account, or
call a \#\#\# friend who knows their password simply edit the page that
gives the faulty directions. \#\#\# But even after successfully logging
in, I do not have permission to edit that page. \#\#\# \#\#\# Yes, I
looked in the forms and didn't see anything there either, though even if
there \#\#\# were something there, that's not very useful without a
clearly labeled "contact us" \#\#\# or "feedback" or "site admin" or
"webmaster" etc... link to it from here. \#\#\# I guess this is as good
a way as any to point out the lack. Had there been some \#\#\# official
place for such dialog, I'd have used it, instead of this messy comment.
\#\#\# \#\#\# Sorry again for the intrusion. \#\#\# Respectfully, wiki

= OpenWrt Community Wiki = Welcome to the !OpenWrt Community Wiki! As
the title suggests, this wiki is for all of you who use, develop with,
and hack on !OpenWrt. It is constantly changing, so don't be surprised
if you find stuff moving around on you.

!OpenWrt is an open-source project to create a free embedded operating
system for network devices. It supports a wide range of
\[:TableOfHardware:Devices\], and device developers can easily add
support for new devices. Software developers, moreover, can add new
\[:OpenWrtDocs/Packages:packages\], which can be built and run on all of
the supported devices.

OpenWrt is aimed at advanced users. If you are new to the world of
!OpenWrt, start with OpenWrtOverview. Basic end-users should also read:
BasicEndUser.

Please join us on the !OpenWrt team.

= Latest Releases = The currently active release is
\[<http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/8.09/> Kamikaze 8.09\].

The latest and final release of the Whiterussian series is
\[<http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/0.9/> 0.9\]. It is a

has been superseded by the Kamikaze series.

= Have Questions? = The !OpenWrt
\[<http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/docs/openwrt.html> manual\] and
\[:Faq:FAQ\] can usually answer most questions. You can also look on the
\[<http://forum.openwrt.org/> forums\], ask on the
\[<http://lists.openwrt.org/> Mailing Lists\], or ask in IRC at
irc.freenode.net, channel \#openwrt. For more information, follow your

users who want basic functionality and \#\#no surprises. | \#\#|
