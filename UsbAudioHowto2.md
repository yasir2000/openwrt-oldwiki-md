= HOWTO turn your USB enabled Router into the coolest Alarm clock ever =
----'''This HOWTO is a work in progress, I have it running, but need to
recreate all the steps. This message will be removed once everything is
in place.''' ----

== Goals: ==

If you follow this HOWTO you should end up with a machine capable of:

> -   Playing mp3/ogg/flac from any mountable source (usb-storage, shfs,
>     cifs, nfs)
> -   Using your Router as an alarm clock
> -   Controlling snooze and alarm times from a bluetooth enabled phone

== Prerequisites: ==

These are the parts i used to achieve the above.

> -   Asus WL500g Premium Router
> -   As of writing: Kamikaze r11112
> -   A supported USB Bluetooth dongle
> -   A supported USB Soundcard

== Caveats: ==

Things which still bother me

> -   I had to disable USB2 support completely as it would not work with
>     my USB hub
> -   anyremote is not yet in OpenWRT, I submitted my files here:
>     \[\[<https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/3433>\]\]
> -   I wanted to be able to plug USB sticks with music in and just have
>     them added to mpd, which required me to hack the usb-storage
>     scripts: \[\[<https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/3432>\]\]
> -   It is not possible to mount DAAP shares, maybe with a 2.6 Kernel
>     and fuse-daap

== HOWTO: ==

> -   Flash your router with a recent Kamikaze build
>
> \* If required, install the provided usb-storage scripts
>
> :   -   You can then add handlers to /etc/usb-handlers.d/ to e.g. link
>         added music to your mpd music directory
>
> \* Disable USB2 and OSS if necesarry:
>
> :   -   rm -f /etc/modules.d/50-usb2
>     -   rm -f /etc/modules.d/60-usb-audio
>
> \* Make sure the following packages are installed:
>
> :   -   '''anyremote''' - remote control program
>     -   '''mpd''' - the music player daemon
>     -   '''mpc''' - mpd control program
>     -   '''at''' - run programs at specific times, used for snooze and
>         alarm
>     -   '''ntpclient''' - make sure you get up on time
>     -   '''bash''' - I think i used some bash features somewhere
>
> -   Set your timezone in /etc/TZ (e.g. Germany:
>     CET-1CEST-2,M3.5.0/02:00:00,M10.5.0/03:00:00)
> -   Set your mpd up to use ALSA by uncommenting the ALSA config
>     entries in /etc/mpd.conf
> -   Create the mpd directories mkdir -p \~/.mpd/playlists
> -   Enable ''sdpd'' in /etc/config/bluetooth
> -   Set auth type in /etc/bluetooth/hicd.conf to ''auto'', set passkey
>     to something usable (e.g. 6712)
> -   Pair your phone with the router
> -   Put the following scripts in /usr/bin/

/usr/bin/alarm - example: alarm 7:00 will set an alarm clock for 7:00
{{{ \#!/bin/bash if \[ -z "\$2" \]; then vol=50 else vol=\$2 fi echo
"/usr/bin/alarm\_play \$vol" | at \$1 }}} /usr/bin/alarm\_play - helper
script for the alarm {{{ \#!/bin/sh if \[ -z \$(mpc | grep playing) \];
then mpc --no-status clear mpc --no-status load alarm\_pl mpc
--no-status volume 0 mpc --no-status random on mpc --no-status play mpc
--no-status pause echo \$1 &gt; \~/.ppvolume /usr/bin/pp & fi }}}
/usr/bin/pp - fade sound in and out, this might be doable in a better
way {{{ \#!/bin/bash

sleep="1s" fade\_sec="10"

curvol=\`mpc | grep "volume" | cut -d " " -f2 | tr -d "%"\` if \[ -z
"mpc | grep playing" \]; then mpc play --no-status start=0 end=\`cat
\$HOME/.ppvolume\` inc=\$((\$end/\$fade\_sec)) else echo \$curvol &gt;
\$HOME/.ppvolume start=\$curvol inc=-\$((\$curvol/\$fade\_sec)) end=0 fi
\#echo \$start \$inc \$end for x in seq \$start \$inc \$end; do mpc
volume \$x --no-status \# mpc volume \$x sleep \$sleep done

if \[ \$end -eq 0 \]; then

:   mpc volume 0 --no-status mpc toggle --no-status

else

:   mpc volume \$end --no-status

fi

> -   You need a playlist alarm\_pl in mpd which will be played at
>     random for alarm
