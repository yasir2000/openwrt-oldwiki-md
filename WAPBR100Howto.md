== Software ==

This unit apparently uses a version of linksys firmware (similar to that
from a WAP54G with bridging, repeating, client, and AP modes).

It comes with boot\_wait set to off, and I could not find a way to
enable it.

This unit DOES have fw-conf.asp to enable changing options for
downgrading and also firmware header verification.

= Getting OpenWRT on this unit = == Preperation ==

> *I don't know if it's required or just simpler, but I set my unit to

> <http://192.168.90.2/fw-conf.asp> (substitute your device's IP) and
> disable the firmware header. \*Get a WAP54G patched image from
> <http://downloads.openwrt.org/people/nbd/whiterussian/> (must be
> squashfs) or build your own using the
> \[:ImageBuilderHowTo:ImageBuilder\] there (kudos to nbd for the
> patch!!!). Make sure its small. I suggest building a basic image (at
> most the size of the 'micro' image) and then seeing how much space you
> have free...

== Installation ==

> *Upload the firmware using the web interface on the unit. I know it's
> normal to use TFTP, but I could not find a way to enable
> boot\_wait.*Let it finish... and voila... your new device should now
> be running OpenWRT!

This includes functionality to mount a cifs filesystem and mount a ext2
filesystem stored there (in a file) via loop.
