== Introduction ==

The Forums have a wealth of information available. It is important to ensure that the http://wiki.openwrt.org (and ultimately the official documentation) benefits from that information. Obviously, the material and nature of the documentation on the wiki has a different emphasis from that to be found on the forums, and therefore it may not be suitable to merely copy and paste material from the forum into the wiki.

== How to Import Material ==

Importing material is mainly a question of common sense. The following guidelines are useful to keep in mind:

 1. Read the [:Team/Documentation/Standards: Documentation standards]! - The number one rule is to read the [:Team/Documentation/Standards: standards]. This provides help on how to use this wiki and some guidelines for adding material. It is very important to get used to how the wiki is organised and formatted if you wish to contribute regularly.
 1. '''Integrate, don't duplicate!''' - Do a comprehensive '''search''' of the help wiki before adding material. If a page already exists on a particular subject, don't add a second one with similar material from the forum. Integrate the material from the forum with the existing page, to improve it. So, new information should be added to the existing page in the appropriate place.
 1. '''Communicate with the author''' - Although the author's permission is not required to copy material from the forum to the help wiki, it is polite to post to the relevant thread to inform them that the material has been integrated into the help wiki, and give some basic details. It may even encourage them to contribute directly to the help wiki!


== List of Pages to be Imported ==

A list of pages on the UDSF and on the forum which would potentially be well-suited for integrating with the help wiki can be found at:
