== Introduction ==
The '''Documentation Team''' is a group of volunteers who, write the official documentation at http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/docs/openwrt.html, maintain the wiki at http://wiki.openwrt.org and manage the documentation that ships with !OpenWrt

Our work consists of writing, editing and updating the documentation for !OpenWrt, as well as gathering the helpful advice from the Mailing-lists and Web Forums for all to use.

New contributors and members are always welcome. People are needed mostly for writing and editing, but there are many other ways of making a useful contribution. For example, simply pointing out errors (such as typos, grammar and spelling, and technical errors) is an extremely useful way to help.

== Contact ==
 * Most communication happens on the Documentation Team '''[http://lists.openwrt.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openwrt-devel mailing list]'''.

== How to Contribute ==
The Documentation Team is always looking for new contributors. See below for a list of ways that you can help out.

===  Write and edit the official documentation ===
The official documentation is kept at '''[http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/docs/openwrt.html]'''.  This documentation is maintained in a svn repository.  Community documentation from the wiki will be added to the official documentation as appropriate.

You can help us by sending suggestions to the Bugtracker or patches to the mailing list.
 
=== Improve the wiki ===
The wiki at '''[http://wiki.openwrt.org wiki.openwrt.org]''' is where the bulk of the documentation is kept. Anyone can edit the wiki, which makes it an ideal place to start contributing.

 * Fix spelling and formatting errors
 * Follow the instructions given in the documentation to see if they work and if they make sense
 * Simplify the structure of long pages
 * Organize untidy pages so that they are easy to read
 * Fix broken links
 * Add new documentation to the wiki
 * Report documentation that you think is missing or inadequate
A list of pages which have been identified as needing improvement can be found in [:Team/Documentation/CategoryCleanup: CategoryCleanup].

=== Import documentation from the forums ===
The [http://forum.openwrt.org forums] contain a wealth of helpful guides on hundreds of different topics. It would be useful to store a lot of this information permanently on the wiki. You can help out by taking guides posted on the forums and turning them into wiki pages on the help wiki.

 * Identify useful documentation on the forums
 * Enhance existing wiki pages using information from the forums
 * Create new wiki pages based on forum guides
 * Ask the authors of guides for permission to use their guides on the wiki
See the [:Team/Documentation/Forum: Forum Importing page] for guidance on how to import forum guides correctly.

== Projects ==
Projects are specif tasks that need to be done to maintain the documentation and keep the wiki up to date.


For a complete list of these projects and the community members who are currently maintaining them, see our [:Team/Documentation/Projects:Projects page].

== Meetings ==
Documentation Team meetings are announced on the mailing list and normally take place in the #need-channel IRC channel on irc.freenode.net. You can find the agenda and time for the next meeting at the [:Team/Documentation/MeetingAgenda: agenda] page.
