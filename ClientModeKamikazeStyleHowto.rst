= Client Mode Wireless =
'''This way is recommended since it is actually automatic:'''

1. Read the instructions and get the tar.gz package from here http://fon.testbox.dk/packages/NEW/LEGEND4.5/clientscript/

That's it. The package of scripts self-installs and will ask you questions to configure your wired and wireless connections. Your current configuration will be backed up and can be restored with the "aprestore" command. Type in "clientmode" after installation to configure client mode. This is currently the easiest and most complete means of having client mode on an Atheros router. These scripts are incompatible with firmwares that use NVRAM. They are included in the Legend Rev4.5 firmware, which will soon be released on the site.  For Fonera and Meraki Mini (or related) routers only.

 * The following instructions will set up routed client-mode wireless on a Fonera device.
 * The two files you'll need to work with are /etc/config/network and /etc/config/wireless.
== WEP ==
/etc/config/network

 * Give the LAN interface a static IP.
 * Configure the WAN interface for DHCP.
{{{
config interface loopback
        option ifname   lo
        option proto    static
        option ipaddr   127.0.0.1
        option netmask  255.0.0.0

        option proto    dhcp}}}
/etc/config/wireless

 * Set the wifi-iface option to sta (client mode).
 * Set the SSID to the one you'll be connecting to.
 * Set the encryption type to WEP.
 * Set the encryption key.

 .
== WPA2-AES ==
Assuming you have WEP working correctly you should now be connected and surfing the web. To get WPA to work you'll need to install the wpa-supplicant package.

{{{
# ipkg update
# ipkg install wpa-supplicant}}}
/etc/config/wireless

{{{
config wifi-device  wifi0
        option type     atheros

#       option rxantenna 0
#       option distance  2000
# disable radio to prevent an open ap after reflashing:
        option disabled 0

 . '''Reboot the device.'''
That should do it; happy hunting.
