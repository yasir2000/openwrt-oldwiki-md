= Objective = Mobile WiFi!

Soon after receiving the new Linksys WRTSL54GS (SL for short) and
getting OpenWRT running on it (thanks Kaloz), my first thought was "what
an awkward product-name!". Second thought was the the many uses for the
USB port. One obvious one was using a cellular phone to attach to the
internet, for mobile WiFi! Not a new idea, but much easier to implement
now.

I should say up front that all cellular data networks have latency that
just blows. Pings of 500+ms are the norm and may bounce up to 2000ms. So
don't expect it to replace your landline. But there are certain good
uses for it, like setting up quick connectivity for a few people at an
event. Or mounted in a vehicle for a totally mobile hotspot! Once you do
get a response, throughput can be pretty good. But you definitely want
to use dnsmasq, and any other caching mechanism you can get your hands
on, to keep things as local as possible.

= Basic connectivity to phone =

== USB modules ==

== Install USB-serial module == First we need to install (and load) some
kernel modules. {{{ <root@OpenWrt>:\~\# ipkg install kmod-usb-ohci
<root@OpenWrt>:\~\# ipkg install kmod-usb-serial <root@OpenWrt>:\~\#
insmod usb-ohci usbserial }}}

== Verify that cellular phone is recognized ==

{{{ <root@OpenWrt>:\~\# logread | tail Jan 1 00:33:01 (none) kern.info
kernel: hub.c: new USB device 01:02.0-1, assigned address 2 Jan 1
00:33:01 (none) kern.warn kernel: usb.c: USB device 2 (vend/prod
0x421/0x40f) is not claimed by any active driver. Jan 1 00:39:01 (none)

(none) kern.info kernel: usbserial.c: USB Serial support registered for
Generic Jan 1 00:39:01 (none) kern.info kernel: usbserial.c: USB Serial
Driver core v1.4 }}}

Those vendor and product numbers, we must do something with them.....

== Modify usb-serial options == {{{ <root@OpenWrt>:\~\# vi
/etc/modules.d/\*-usb-serial usbserial vendor=0x421 product=0x40f
<root@OpenWrt>:\~\# reboot }}}

== Install microcrom so we can check things out == {{{
<root@OpenWrt>:\~\# ipkg install microcom }}}

== Verify we can talk to phone, by typing AT to modem, see if it
responds OK == {{{ <root@OpenWrt>:\~\# microcom -D/dev/usb/tts/0 AT

OK

}}}

:)

Hit \~x to get out of microcom

= PPP conectivity =

== Install PPP == {{{ <root@OpenWrt>:\~\# ipkg install kmod-ppp
<root@OpenWrt>:\~\# ipkg install ppp <root@OpenWrt>:\~\# ipkg install
chat <root@OpenWrt>:\~\# reboot }}}

== PPP config file ==

This part took some Googling. Finally I found a good page that I used as
the basis:
\[<http://www.advantedgecomputing.com/opensource/gc83linux.html>\]

{{{ <root@OpenWrt>:\~\# mkdir /etc/ppp/peers <root@OpenWrt>:\~\# vi

== PPP device setup == First attempt to use our setup will give an
error, unless we fix it. {{{ <root@OpenWrt>:\~\# pppd call cingular
pppd: pppd is unable to open the /dev/ppp device. You need to create the
/dev/ppp device node by executing the following command as root: mknod
/dev/ppp c 108 0 <root@OpenWrt>:\~\# mkdir /var/lock <root@OpenWrt>:\~\#
vi /etc/modules.d/70-ppp slhc ppp\_generic ppp\_async }}}

== Lock file directory creation == If we are going to have the "lock"
option in the config file, we need the /var/lock directory created. By
nature OpenWRT recreates /var on each boot. So add a startup script that
ensures it is created on each boot. {{{ <root@OpenWrt>:\~\# vi
/etc/init.d/S80ppp \#!/bin/sh mkdir -p /var/lock <root@OpenWrt>:\~\#
chmod +x /etc/init.d/S80ppp }}}

== WAN interface change == Time to cut the umbilical cord. Unplug the
WAN port ethernet line used for all this setup work. {{{
<root@OpenWrt>:\~\# nvram set wan\_device=ppp0 <root@OpenWrt>:\~\# nvram
set wan\_ifname=ppp0 <root@OpenWrt>:\~\# nvram commit
<root@OpenWrt>:\~\# reboot }}}

== Time for test drive! == {{{ <root@OpenWrt>:\~\# pppd call cingular
debug nodetach (output) }}}

Hopefully you made WOO-HOO noises at this point as you watched it
successfully connect.

== Check connectivity == {{{ <root@OpenWrt>:\~\# ifconfig ppp0 ppp0 Link

}}}

= Usage = All you should need to do is ssh in, and execute: {{{
<root@OpenWrt>:\~\# pppd call cingular }}}

I am adding this last few lines of text, using the Nokia PPP connection
:)

= Misc = How about a little script to monitor the SES button and
connect? {{{ <root@OpenWrt>:\~\# vi /usr/sbin/dialmon \#!/bin/sh junk=0
until \[ \$junk -eq 1 \] do sleep 1 read junk &lt;/proc/sys/button done
\# turn on white LED in SES button echo 32 &gt; /proc/sys/diag
/usr/sbin/pppd call cingular <root@OpenWrt>:\~\# chmod +x
/usr/sbin/dialmon }}} Let's use SES amber to show connect status. Add
echo to these files: {{{ <root@OpenWrt>:\~\# cd /etc/ppp
<root@OpenWrt>:\~\# rm ip-up ip-down <root@OpenWrt>:\~\# cp
/rom/etc/ppp/ip-up . <root@OpenWrt>:\~\# cp /rom/etc/ppp/ip-down .
<root@OpenWrt>:\~\# vi ip-up \#!/bin/sh \[ -z "\$6" \] | env -i
ACTION="ifdown" INTERFACE="\$6" PROTO=ppp /sbin/hotplug "iface" echo 0
&gt;/proc/sys/diag }}}

Now just run "dialmon &", and push the button!

I have this setup in my automobile, with the dialmon script set to run
on boot. I suppose I should recode dialmon to also perform disconnect on
another button-press, but I usually just cut power to the unit when I am
done.

= HotPlug =

We can use hotplug capability to do the connection. A script like this:

{{{ echo 1 | /usr/sbin/pppd \$TTY \$SPEED
 lock
 modem
 name \$ISP
 user zapp
 debug kdebug 3
 connect '/usr/sbin/chat -v -s -f /etc/ppp/chat-sprintpcs' }}}

= Notes =

> 1.  This document for the SL was inspired by Nate True's page:
>     <http://devices.natetrue.com/mobileap/>
> 2.  Would be nice to have a local clock source, as the SL has no clock
>     and comes up with wrong time at boot. PPP does note the large time
>     disparity in the logs. You can sync after connecting with rdate or
>     ntpclient, obvious place to append this is in /etc/ppp/ip-up.
