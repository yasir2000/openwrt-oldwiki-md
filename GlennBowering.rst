== WRT54GL ==

I have recently started the page InstallingWrt54gl based on my experience installing !OpenWrt on the !LinkSys WRT54GL router.  I hope you enjoy it.  Please modify it as needed.  Currently, we are connecting two serial ports to the WRT54GL we'll keep you informed of our progress.  Our overall goal is to run a wireless adhoc algorithm in the application layer and essentially modify the existing Linux stack to allow us to easily inject packets up the stack and capture them going down the stack.  Essentially the WRT54GL will have two interfaces for our task, that of 802.11b and a 900mHz radio.  More details to follow.  Please contact me if you've done anything similiar ;)

If you have any questions regarding installation of !OpenWrt on the WRT54GL please let message me here (include WRT54GL in the subject line)
