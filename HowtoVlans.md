White Russian (RC5 and all later versions) use a new ethernet driver
(b44) and switch driver to configure the switch and VLANs. The switch
driver will be configured by a /proc/switch interface. This driver works
for ROBO and ADMTEK switches. The syntax of these files is exactly the
same as the vlan\*ports variables documented elsewhere on the wiki.

{{{ vlan0ports -&gt; /proc/switch/eth0/vlan/0/ports vlan1ports -&gt;
/proc/switch/eth0/vlan/1/ports vlan2ports -&gt;
/proc/switch/eth0/vlan/2/ports ... }}}
