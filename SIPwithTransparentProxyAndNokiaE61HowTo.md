On the Nokia E61 I got the following settings

Have fun, though I have a litte knacking during calls. Don't know the
reason yet.

----= Another way of making NOKIA E60, E61 (and probably other) phones
work behind the OpenWRT router. =

Those "litte knackings during calls" mentioned above may have caused by
high CPU consumption of siproxd processes. I have two SIP clients
connected and CPU usage sometimes raises up to 40%. I also noticed much
longer delays when establishing or receiving calls (really longer, up to
10-15 seconds depending on the system load).

Another way of making some SIP clients (like NOKIA E60 or E61) to work
through OpenWRT is changing the default NAT behaviour from MASQUERADE to
SourceNAT (SNAT), which will make your NOKIA (or any other SIP client)
transparently work with OpenWRT ''without'' siproxd and additional
ipt\_REDIRECT firewall rules.

This setup was tested with NOKIA E60 phone and Asterisk VoIP server
(Trixbox based). I think it should work with other service providers as
well. If you are using Asterisk and this solution is not working for
you, try to add the following parameters to your extension configuration
of the Asterisk box:

> {{{
>
> :   nat=yes qualify=yes
>
> }}}

If you have already followed the above instructions and installed '''siproxd''' and '''iptables-mod-nat''', then you may safely uninstall them to save flash space:

:   1.  '''ipkg remove siproxd'''
    2.  '''ipkg remove libosip2'''
    3.  '''ipkg remove iptables-mod-nat'''

And you '''have to remove''' those three lines from '''/etc/firewall.user''' (if you have already appended them):

:   

    {{{

    :   insmod ipt\_REDIRECT iptables -A input\_vlan1 -p udp -m udp
        --dport 7070:7079 -j ACCEPT iptables -t nat -I prerouting\_rule
        -m udp -p udp -i br0 --destination-port 5060 -j REDIRECT

    }}}

After it's done, edit the '''/etc/init.d/S45firewall''' script and
change the following:

1. add this line at the beginning of the file right after the LAN=...... statement:

:   {{{ WAN=\$(nvram get wan\_ifname) LAN=\$(nvram get lan\_ifname)
    EXTIP=\$(ifconfig vlan1 | grep 'inet addr' | cut -f 2 -d: | cut -f 1
    -d' ') }}}

This line will automagically extract your WAN ip address from
'''ifconfig''' output to use later in this script (maybe there is a more
correct way to do this but I don't know).

2. replace the following line at the MASQ section:

:   {{{ iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o \$WAN -j MASQUERADE }}}

with

:   {{{ iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o \$WAN -j SNAT --to-source
    \$EXTIP }}}

That's all, just save the file and reboot the router. The NOKIA SIP
account configuration should remain unchanged and it will work with your
new settings.

SIP calls work without any problems and calls are established with no
delay at all.
