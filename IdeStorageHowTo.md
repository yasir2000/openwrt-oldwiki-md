'''IDE Storage HowTo'''

Some devices supported by !OpenWrt have an IDE interface. To configure
this:

> -   install the ''kmod-ide'' package,
> -   install the ''kmod-ext3'' package if you wish to use an EXT3
>     filesystem,
>
> \* configure ''/etc/modules'' to load kernel modules in the correct
> order, for example: {{{

ide-core pdc202xx\_old ide-detect ide-disk wl jbd ext3 }}} \* load the
modules manually using ''insmod'' or reboot, \* check that the IDE drive
is detected; the file ''/proc/partitions'' will contain a line for the
whole disk and a line for each partition, \* see LocalFileSystemHowTo
for how to create filesystems and make them available to other hosts.
