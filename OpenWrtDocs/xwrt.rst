'''X-Wrt'''

[http://www.bitsum.com/xwrt.htm X-Wrt] is a project to enhance the end user experience of OpenWrt. It is currently under active development. X-Wrt is developed by a different group than is the base OpenWrt firmware and is therefore not affiliated with OpenWrt, nor is it supported by OpenWrt. Since many users may be interested what X-Wrt has to offer, some basic information about it is included here.

== webif^2: Enhanced HTTP management console ==
'''webif^2^''' is an enhanced webif (HTTP based management console) for White Russian, and soon Kamikaze.

It offers a large number of new features and is constantly being improved. Some of the many things it offers are:

 * Firewall configuration
 * QoS configuration
 * DHCP/Dnsmasq configuration
 * File editor/browser
 * CPU and Traffic Graphs (SVG)
 * Too much to possibly list...

Some of the more popular additions are the real-time traffic and CPU graphs, a switchable color theme, and a number of new webif pages for both configuration and status reporting.
