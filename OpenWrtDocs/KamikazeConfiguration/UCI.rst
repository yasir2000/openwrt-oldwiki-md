= What is UCI =
'''U'''nified '''C'''onfiguration '''I'''nterface.

UCI is a very flexible and modular interface to store configurations in plain text files. The text files are stored by default in /etc/config/<application> and they all have the structure like <section> <option> <name> = <value>. UCI was specially written for embedded systems where it makes no sense or where you have not the ressources to run a database to store the configuration. UCI is written in C and and a command-line interface is available to modify the configuration files via the shell without the need of using a text editor.
