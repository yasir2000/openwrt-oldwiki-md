  * [http://pobletewireless.blogspot.com/2006/05/monta-un-conector-sma-reverse-en-tu.html] Add a SMA-R connector to your WRT54G
	Note: the author of that page used ordinary hookup wire, which would cause impedence mismatch and reduced performance or even hardware damage. The proper way is to use coax cable of the proper impedence. Better yet, remove the original connector so it doesn't act as a "stub" to the RF signal. - star882
