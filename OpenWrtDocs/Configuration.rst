Please update to include other models.

'''NOTE:''' LAN and WIFI are bridged together in br0 by default, on some devices WAN can be eth1 and LAN eth0.

The basic network configuration is handled by a series of NVRAM variables:
{{{
#!CSV
NVRAM; Description
<name>_ifname; The name of the linux interface the settings apply to
<name>_ifnames; Devices to be added to the bridge (only if the above is a bridge)
<name>_proto; The protocol which will be used to configure an IP
            ; static: Manual configuration (see below)
            ; dhcp: Perform a DHCP request
            ; pppoe: Create a ppp tunnel
<name>_ipaddr; ip address (x.x.x.x)
<name>_netmask; netmask (x.x.x.x)
<name>_gateway; Default Gateway (x.x.x.x)
<name>_dns; DNS server (x.x.x.x)
<name>_hostname; hostname requested with dhcp
<name>_hwaddr; MAC address (aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff) if you want to use a different MAC of the ROM
}}}
The command ''ifup <name>'' will configure the interface defined by <name>_ifname according to the above variables. As an example, the {{{/etc/init.d/S40network}}} script will automatically run the following commands at boot:

{{{
ifup lan
ifup wan
ifup wifi
}}}
The ''ifup lan'' command will bring up the interface specified by lan_ifname. Normally the lan_ifname is set to br0 which will cause it to create the bridge br0 and add the the interfaces from lan_ifnames to the bridge; lan_proto is usually static which means that br0 will have the IP address from lan_ipaddr, and so on for the rest of the variables listed above.

It's important to remember that it's the <name>_ifname that specifies the interfaces, the <name> compontent itself has almost no value. This means that if you changed lan_ifname to be the internet port, vlan1, then ''ifup lan'' would bring up the internet port, not the lan ports (despite using the command ''ifup lan'' and using the lan_ variables). Also, it means that you can create any <name> variables you want, foo_ifname, foo_proto .... and they would be used by ''ifup foo''.

The only <name> with any significance is '''wan''', used by the /etc/init.d/S45firewall script. The firewall script will NAT traffic through the wan_ifname, blocking connections to wan_ifname.

Further information about the variables used can be found at ["OpenWrtNVRAM"].

Don't forget to check the OpenWrtFaq for information about howto setup PPPoE etc.

'''Sample network configurations'''

For client mode configuration (rather than AP mode), see this page: ClientModeHowto. For further information on '''DHCP''' see this page ["dnsmasq"]

('''NOTE:''' these examples use WRT54G v2.x/WRT54GS v1.x interface names)

The default network configuration (LAN + wireless bridged as 192.168.1.1/24, WAN as DHCP):
{{{
lan_ifname=br0
lan_ifnames="vlan0 eth1"
lan_proto=static
lan_ipaddr=192.168.1.1
lan_netmask=255.255.255.0
wan_ifname=vlan1
wan_proto=dhcp
}}}

If you just want to use !OpenWrt as an access point you can avoid the WAN interface completely (LAN+wireless bridged as 192.168.1.25/24, routed through 192.168.1.1, WAN ignored):
{{{
lan_ifname=br0
lan_ifnames="vlan0 eth1"
lan_proto=static
lan_ipaddr=192.168.1.25
lan_netmask=255.255.255.0
lan_gateway=192.168.1.1
lan_dns=192.168.1.1
wan_proto=none
}}}

The above configuration also serves as a wireless to ethernet bridge. For e.g. you can have a PC with a wlan card with a static IP address be switched (bridged) to an ethernet LAN. Neither the IP address of the lan gateway,  or the dhcp server on the LAN interface interferes with this bridged configuration.

You can also have the lan interface fetch its configuration via DHCP, but to do so, you'll have to comment out the line:
{{{
# linksys bug; remove when not using static configuration for lan
nvram set lan_proto="static"
}}}
in /etc/init.d/S05nvram (The usual story about replacing the symlink with a copy of the file before editting applies). After doing this, you need to set the appropriate nvram variable:

{{{
lan_proto=dhcp
}}}
To separate the LAN from the WIFI (LAN as 192.168.1.25/24, wireless as 192.168.2.25/24, WAN as DHCP, remove your WIFI interface (eth1 on v2/3 linksys routers) from the lan_ifnames variable):

{{{
lan_ifname=vlan0
lan_proto=static
lan_ipaddr=192.168.1.25
lan_netmask=255.255.255.0
wifi_ifname=eth1
wifi_proto=static
wifi_ipaddr=192.168.2.25
wifi_netmask=255.255.255.0
wan_ifname=vlan1
wan_proto=dhcp
lan_ifnames="vlan0"
}}}
'''You MUST do this if you want to use ad-hoc mode, otherwise your throughput WILL suffer!'''

= Ethernet switch configuration =

Most of the routers supported by OpenWrt include a builtin switch; four lan ports and one wan port. What most people don't realize is that all of these ports are actually the same interface -- there is a single 10/100 ethernet which is fed into a 6 port switch. 5 of the ports are external and make the lan and wan ports seen on the back of the router, and one port is internally wired to the router's ethernet interface.

The separation of lan and wan comes from the use of VLANs. By grouping ports into VLANs, the switch can be broken up into smaller virtual switches, and by adding VLAN tags to packets, OpenWrt can control which virtual switch (which ports) the packet gets routed.

There are normally two VLANs, vlan0 and vlan1. For each VLAN, there are two nvram variables, vlan*ports and vlan*hwname. So, the variables for vlan0 might look like this:

{{{
vlan0ports="1 2 3 4 5*" (use ports 1-4 on the back, 5 is the WRT54G itself)
vlan0hwname=et0
}}}
(See switch diagram in section 2)

The vlan0ports variable is a space separated list of port numbers to be included in vlan0. Ports "1-4" on this router represent the lan ports on the back of the router, port 5 represents the connection between the switch itself and OpenWrt's ethernet interface. Since port 5 is OpenWrt's only connection to the switch, it is tagged by default -- this means that the VLAN information is preserved so OpenWrt is able to tell if a packet came from vlan0 or vlan1. All other ports are untagged by default, meaning that the VLAN information is removed by the switch so the port can be used by devices that aren't VLAN aware.

The port numbers used in the vlan*ports may optionally include a character after the port number. If a port number is followed by a "t" then the port is tagged, a "u" means untagged.

A "*" means that this VLAN is the primary VLAN (PVID); if a port is used in multiple vlans, packets without any VLAN information will be given to the primary VLAN for that port.

The second variable, vlan0hwname is used by the network configuration program (the ifup scripts) to determine the parent interface. This should be set to "et0" meaning the interface matching et0macaddr. The reason it's labeled "et0" and not "eth0" is mostly due to vxworks -- it's a legacy issue and OpenWrt keeps the "et0" name to be compatible with the existing settings.

As of RC4, the switch is programmed and controlled by a set of switch modules (switch-core and switch-robo or switch-adm, depending on your hardware). These switch modules will create a /proc/switch/eth0, showing the current settings for the switch. The /proc/switch/eth0/vlan/0/ports is used the exact same way as the vlan0ports nvram variable, allowing you to change the switch settings in realtime.

'''Sample configurations'''
(unless otherwise specified, vlan variables not shown are assumed to be unset)

Default:
{{{
vlan0ports="1 2 3 4 5*"
vlan0hwname=et0
vlan1ports="0 5"
vlan1hwname=et0
}}}

All ports lan (vlan0):
{{{
vlan0ports="0 1 2 3 4 5*"
vlan0hwname=et0
}}}

LAN (vlan0), WAN (vlan1), DMZ (vlan2):
{{{
vlan0ports="1 2 5*"
vlan0hwname=et0
vlan1ports="0 5"
vlan1hwname=et0
vlan2ports="3 4 5"
vlan2hwname=et0
}}}

It's a good idea when choosing a vlan layout to keep port 1 in vlan0. At least the WRT54GS v1.0 will not accept new firmware via TFTP if port 1 is in another VLAN.

Avoid using WEP keys with 00 at the end, otherwise the driver won't be able to detect the key length correctly. A 128 bit WEP key must be 26 hex digits long ; string key format is also supported : '''nvram set wl0_key1='s:my string key' '''

Setting up WPA will override any WEP settings.

== Wireless Distribution System (WDS) / Repeater / Bridge ==
!OpenWrt supports the WDS protocol, which allows a point to point link to be established between two access points. By default, WDS links are added to the br0 bridge, treating them as part of the lan/wifi segment; clients will be able to seamlessly connect through either access point using wireless or the wired lan ports as if they were directly connected.

Configuration of WDS is simple, and depends on one of two variables

{{{
#!CSV
NVRAM; Description
wl0_lazywds; Accept WDS connections from anyone (0:disabled 1:enabled)
wl0_wds; List of WDS peer mac addresses (xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx, space separated)
}}}
For security reasons, it's recommended that you leave wl0_lazywds off and use wl0_wds to control WDS access to your AP. wl0_wds functions as an access list of peers to accept connections from and peers to try to connect to; the peers will either need the mac address of your AP in their wl0_wds list, or wl0_lazywds enabled.

Easy steps for a successful WDS:

First do it without wireless protection and then activate the protection. If you activate both you will double the pain to find a problem.

 1. Configure the IPs of each AP - don't use the same! For easier maintenance you can use the same subnet.
 1. Add the '''other''' APs MAC address to the list of allowed peers to each AP. With OpenWRT it's the variable wl0_wds.
 1. Disable all the unneeded services like DHCP, port forwarding, firewalling etc. '''except''' on the AP the has the internet connection. Remember: The other APs only act as the extended arm of the internet connected AP.
 1. Configure the WLAN parameters on all APs identical. That is SSID, channel, etc. - keep it simple. If you want to try boosters etc. do this later. (In [:JonathanKollasch:my] experience the SSIDs need not be identical for WDS to work, but YMMV.)
 1. Have you commited your values? Do it. And reboot.
 1. Now connect a lan cable to each AP and try to ping the internet AP. It should answer. Else start checking the settings.
 1. You are done. Now activate security on the devices. Optionally hide the SSID (wl0_closed=1). If WPA-PSK doesn't work chances are that a peer partner doesn't support it. Try WEP.
/!\ I experienced 20% packet loss using lazywds. It went away when disabling lazywds. You have been warned!

/!\ '''NOTE:''' WDS requires a br0 interface. If you broke up your bridge as detailed in "To separate the LAN from the WIFI" above, this will not just work, since you no longer have a br0. You do not need to add any interfaces to br0, the WDS interfaces will be automatically added.

== WDS Routed Networks (P2P) ==

You might want to use routing over the WDS links, rather than bridging. You will want to break up the bridge, as explained above, and prevent wds devices from being added to the bridge by editing /etc/hotplug.d/net/01-wds.


You can then add WDS interfaces, e.g:
{{{
nvram set wl0_wds="00:14:12:25:CB:22 00:14:12:16:3B:28"
}}}

This will give you several wds0.x interfaces (note the interface names get truncated when displayed in ifconfig -- they start at wds0.49153 and increment by 0.00001). Create a set of nvram variables for ifup, e.g:
{{{
nvram set wds1_proto=static
nvram set wds1_ifname=wds0.49153
nvram set wds1_ipaddr=192.168.254.97
nvram set wds1_netmask=255.255.255.252

nvram set wds2_proto=static
nvram set wds2_ifname=wds0.49154
nvram set wds2_ipaddr=192.168.254.100
nvram set wds2_netmask=255.255.255.252
}}}

Then modify /etc/init.d/S40network to bring up these interfaces:
{{{
    ifup wds1
    ifup wds2
}}}

== A note on encryption with WDS ==
WDS is exceptionally easy to set up.  You can do it in from the web interface under Wireless. WDS will work OOB with either no encryption or WEP; other than setting your WEP key (as normal) no configuration is required.

When using WPA with WDS, the simplest method is to ensure that both routers are using the same ESSID and WDS settings; if so, you don't need to set any additional variables besides '''wl0_wds'''. However, some people may want to use different encryption for the WDS link than for clients, or different ESSIDs for different routers; if so, there are a number of wds_specific nvram variables that can be set; ensure that all WDS peers have the same values for these variables. If the variables are unset (as they are by default), WDS will use the same encryption settings as used for clients.
|| '''NVRAM variable''' || '''Description''' ||
|| wl0_wds_wpa_psk || Your wireless password ||
|| wl0_wds_akm || The key type (i.e. psk) ||
|| wl0_wds_crypto || The algorithm (i.e. aes) ||
|| wl0_wds_ssid || The ssid (has to be the same at both ends, if used - see below) ||


If using WDS between routers with different ESSIDs, you should all of their '''wl0_wds_ssid''' variables to the ESSID of ''one'' of the routers, so that they will be able to talk to each other.

Note that it appears that there is a bug in nas that prevents WPA2 from working properly with WDS.  It is known that WPA1 works.

Remember that the non-free package NAS must be installed for WPA to work.  It is also noted on the forum that you may be able to use WPA1 for the WDS link and WPA2 for client PCs; however, consider that the protection offered by WPA is only as good as the weakest link in the chain.  Any data sent over the WDS link (including connections originating from client PCs connected to the satellite AP) will be vulnerable to an attack on WPA1.

== Wireless client / wireless bridge ==
The only thing you have to do is to switch the WL mode like with the bridge:

{{{
nvram set wl0_mode=wet
}}}
For more information, see ClientModeHowto.

= Basic system configuration and usage =
== busybox - The Swiss Army Knife of Embedded Linux ==
== cron - job scheduler ==
See HowtoEnableCron.

== syslog - Logging ==
To read the syslog messages, use the '''logread''' command. See MiniHowtos to set up remote logging.

== dropbear - Secure Shell server ==
For SSH login without password, put your keys in /etc/dropbear/authorized_keys. See DropbearPublicKeyAuthenticationHowto.

== iptables - Firewall ==
The rules and some small samples for your firewall can be found in /etc/firewall.user.  If you want to make changes to this file, you'll have to remove it first, since it is actually a symlink to /rom/etc/firewall.user.

{{{
ls -l /etc/firewall.user
rm /etc/firewall.user
cp /rom/etc/firewall.user /etc
}}}
Be sure to read the notes about the firewall rules before changing anything.  The important thing to note is that if you setup port forwarding, you won't be able to see the changes inside the router's LAN.  You will have to access the router from outside to verify the setup.

The first section, '''Open port to WAN''' shows an example of opening a port for your router running OpenWRT to listen to and accept.  In the case given, it will open up port 22 and accept connections using dropbear (the SSH server).  Just delete the '''#''' sign in front of the two rules to enable access.

If you wanted to open up any other ports for the router to listen to, just copy those two lines and change just the port number from 22 to something else.

The second section, '''Port forwarding''' is for accepting incoming connections from the WAN (outside the router) and sending the requests to a networked device on your LAN (inside your router).

Before setting up any port forwarding, you'll have to install some OpenWRT packages first, such as iptables-nat and ip (any others?).

In the example provided, if someone on the Internet were to connect to your router on port 8080, it would forward them to port 80 on whatever computer / device had the IP address of 192.168.1.2.

If you are running a webserver on that address, and want to listen on port 80 instead, change the 8080 on the first line.

The same is true for any other ports you'd want to forward to your LAN.  Just follow the example as a guide.

The last section, '''DMZ''' is sending all connections to a port not specified in the rules above to a certain IP address.  If you do decide to use this, it would be a good idea to have a firewall managing the ports on the destination.  The DMZ can be considered a simple way to let another computer handle the firewall rules, if you don't want to configure them on OpenWRT and at the same time you want to send all connections to one device.

Once you're finished making changes to your firewall, restart it by running the init script:

{{{
/etc/init.d/S45firewall restart
}}}
Remember to test the changes outside your LAN!

== dnsmasq - DNS and DHCP server ==
Dnsmasq is a lightweight, easy to configure DNS forwarder and DHCP server.

Documentation can be found at ["OpenWrtDocs/dnsmasq"].

== Time ==
Most devices supported by !OpenWrt have no real-time clock hardware onboard, and must get the date and time at boot or use the default of 2000-01-01.

You must have the correct time to use OpenVPN on !OpenWrt. The same applies to other tools using CA certificates such as wget and curl.

You may use either ''ntpclient'', ''rdate'', ''htpdate'' or ''openntpd''. Only ''rdate'' is included by default.

'''rdate'''

The ''rdate'' command synchronises the system time to the time on a remote host using the time protocol on TCP port 37.  It is normally used once during boot, and then the kernel maintains the time based on the processor oscillator. It will slowly drift.  ''rdate'' is part of the ''busybox'' package and is already installed.

Create the file {{{/etc/init.d/S42rdate}}} with the contents:

{{{
#!/bin/sh
/usr/sbin/rdate HOST}}}
replacing HOST with the IP address or host name of the time server, then make it executable:

{{{
chmod a+x /etc/init.d/S42rdate}}}
then either reboot or run it this once:

{{{
/etc/init.d/S42rdate}}}

'''ntpclient'''

''ntpclient'' will synchronize the system time using the NTP protocol when the internet connection is established.
To set it up follow this instructions :

Set the ''ntp_server'' NVRAM variable to your preferred NTP server (for example the NTP server of your ISP; if no server is set, ''ntpclient'' will use ''pool.ntp.org'' as default):

{{{
nvram set ntp_server=ntp.my-isp.net
nvram commit
}}}

Install the ''ntpclient'' package in the web interface or using the command
{{{
ipkg install ntpclient
}}}

''ntpclient'' will now update the system time each time the WAN connection is established.
To set the time manually use this command line 
{{{
/usr/sbin/ntpclient -c 1 -d -s -h ntp.my-isp.net
}}}
or reboot the router. (the ''-d'' option just prints some info about what is going on, you can leave it out)

== Timezone ==
Without a time zone set, !OpenWrt will display UTC.

To set a time zone use the {{{/etc/TZ}}} file. Copy & paste the time zones from the table below into the file. In this example it's done with the {{{echo}}} command.

{{{
echo "CET-1CEST-2,M3.5.0/02:00:00,M10.5.0/03:00:00" > /etc/TZ
}}}
'''NOTE:''' This sets the time zone for CET/CEST (Central European Time UTC+1 / Central European Summer Time UTC+2) and the starting (5th week of March at 02:00) and endtime (5th week of October at 03:00) of DST (Daylight Saving Time).

^1^in August of 2005, the United States President Bush passed the [http://www.fedcenter.gov/_kd/Items/actions.cfm?action=Show&item_id=2969&destination=ShowItem Energy Policy Act], which, among other things, changes the time change dates for daylight saving time from the first Sunday in April to the second Sunday in March and from the last Sunday in October to the first Sunday in November. This pattern starts in 2007, however, and Congress still has time to revert the DST back. As such, these changes have not yet been incorporated into mainline uClibc (which provides the time functions for the C library used by OpenWrt). Therefore, it might be a good idea to change {{{/etc/TZ}}} explicitly (around mid-November 2006) to reflect this change (i.e., instead of {{{EST5EDT}}} write {{{EST5EDT,M3.2.0,M11.1.0}}}).
