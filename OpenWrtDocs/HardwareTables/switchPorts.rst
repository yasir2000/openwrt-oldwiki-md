== Switch ports ==
and related notes

=== Intro ===
Certainly there are several systems without 4+1 ethernet ports, no wifi hardware, etc., so the documented default OpenWrt firmware configuration will not fit for sure. But beware, even with the common router layout "integrated 4-port switch plus WAN port and wifi" there may be an unusual setting required to make the hardware work according to your expectation. I.e. recently delivered systems in the popular Linksys Wrt**** series have the internal port numbers (used for addressing ports in the VLAN configuration) assigned differently from the port numbers written to the case.

Note: Add more hints to hardware the default OpenWrt configuration doesn't apply to, please. It would be good to know the default OpenWrt setting (fresh flashed) for these systems as well as needed or recommended alternative settings.
