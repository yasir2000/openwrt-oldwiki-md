= Basic End User =
At this time !OpenWrt is not designed as a simple to install and use end user product.  
!OpenWrt is a development environment for others to build end user products.   Please see [:http://x-wrt.org/:X-Wrt] for one such product.

With that in mind, feel free to download and install a prebuilt image for your device.  But, be aware there is not going to be much hand holding.  We are more like Debian then Ubuntu in that respect.
