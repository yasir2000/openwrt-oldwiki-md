'''OpenWRT will run on every Broadcom 47xx/53xx based hardware, although some tweaking may be involved.'''

==== How can I identify which hardware I have? ====
===== Linksys models =====
On the bottom of the device is a silver sticker with a Linksys logo on it, under this logo are the words "Model No." followed by the model number of the device (WRT54G, WRT54GS, WAP54G). If there isn't a version number (v1.1, v2.0, v2.2) after the model then it's a v1.0 device.

/!\ If you have a WRT54G v2.2 or a WRT54GS v1.1 then OpenWrt will not yet run on these models. Read the forum for more information on the experimental releases for these models.
