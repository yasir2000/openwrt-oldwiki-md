===== Linksys models =====
On the bottom of the device is a silver sticker with a Linksys logo on it, under this logo are the words "Model No." followed by the model number of the device (WRT54G, WRT54GS, WAP54G). If there isn't a version number (v1.1, v2.0, v2.2) after the model then it's a v1.0 device.

You can identify them better using the serial number table on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrt54g WRT54G wikipedia entry].
