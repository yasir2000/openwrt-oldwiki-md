= Introduction =
These pages will describe building the hardware and software required to add an I2C bus and a Real-Time Clock to the Linksys WRT54GL router.
The I2C bus is very versatile and can interface with many components such as eeprom memory chips, GPS location detectors, solid-state compasses, LCD displays and of course the Real-Time clock chip described here.

Eventually more I2C projects will be documented here.
