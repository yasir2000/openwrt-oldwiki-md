= Introduction =
These pages will describe building the hardware and software required to add an I2C bus and a Real-Time Clock to the Linksys WRT54GL router.
The I2C bus is very versatile and can interface with many components such as eeprom memory chips, GPS location detectors, solid-state compasses, LCD displays and of course the Real-Time clock chip described here.

Eventually more I2C projects will be documented here.

The information presented here was partially gathered from sources on the Internet
including the following:[[BR]][http://www.linksysinfo.org] and [http://openwrt.org]:

'''Firmware:''' `OpenWrt Whiterussian 0.9`[[BR]]
'''Kernel driver:''' i2c-mips-gpio:[[BR]]
Based on original i2c-mips-gpio by John Newbigin,[[BR]]
which in turn was based on i2c-philips-par.c by Simon G. Vogl.[[BR]]
Changed to sb_gpio-Interface by Torsten Landschoff.[[BR]]
4-wire logic and final version by niclas at datenritter dot de.[[BR]]
'''User space binaries''' are modified versions of utilities provided in the lm_sensors package: [http://www.lm-sensors.org][[BR]]
'''Schematics''' were created with gEDA: [http://www.geda.seul.org]
