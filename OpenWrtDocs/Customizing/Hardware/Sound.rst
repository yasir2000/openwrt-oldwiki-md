= Adding Sound Output =
Although it is easy to add sound to a router with USB, (See the above USB section)  it takes some work for one without. One method which has worked successfully is to add a Covox. A  covox http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covox_Speech_Thing is a simple 8-bit digital  to analogue converter. It was a common sound device for PCs before sound cards  and higher quality audio devices were cheap. On PCs it was driven by the parallel  port. On a router it can be driven by a serial port. All that would be necessary  is to convert the serial data to parallel. A shift register would work, the below  example uses a PIC microcontroller.
