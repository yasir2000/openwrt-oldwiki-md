The objective is to configure a box that serve as an imap server of all your mails.

So we need the following tools
 * fetchmail to get your mails from the outside accounts
 * procmail to deliver it to the right recipient ad eventually process the messages
 * dovecot to configure an imap server

As we need to have the ssl support in fetchmail (to be able to connect to gmail for example) we need to recompile it as the version you find in kamikaze 7.09 doesn't support ssl.

So you have to download the build environment 

svn co https://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/tags/kamikaze_7.09
