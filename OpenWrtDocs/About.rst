= About OpenWrt for sagar =

!OpenWrt takes a different route, instead of starting out with the Linksys sources, the
development started with a clean slate. Piece by piece software was added to bring the
functionality back to that of the stock firmware, using the most recent versions available.
What makes !OpenWrt really unique though is the fact it employs a writable filesystem so the
firmware is no longer a static compilation of software but can instead be dynamically adjusted
to fit the particular needs of the situation. In short, the device is turned into a mini linux
PC with !OpenWrt acting as the distribution, complete with almost all traditional linux commands
and a package management system for easily loading on extra software and features.


= Why should I run OpenWrt? =

Because GNU/Linux gives us the power to do what we need with cheap hardware while avoiding proprietary,
rigid software. !OpenWrt isn't for the faint of heart, but if you honestly need a barebones GNU/Linux
and are prepared to do some work !OpenWrt is the fastest Linux based firmware for the Linksys Wrt's.
At the moment the distribution contains more than 100 software packages. Furthermore the !OpenWrt
community provide more add-on packages. For developers the project provides a build system, which may
be used to create modified firmware from source. Porting of new software packages is simplified with
the use of the SDK.


= OpenWrt Version History =

The project started in January 2004. The first !OpenWrt versions were based on Linksys original GPL
sources for WRT54G and a buildroot from the uclibc project. This version is known as !OpenWrt "stable"
and was widely in use. There are still many !OpenWrt applications, like the Freifunk-Firmware or
Sip@Home, which are based on this version.

In the beginning of 2005 some new developers have joined the small developer team. After some month of
closed development the team decided to publish the first "experimental" versions of !OpenWrt. The
experimental version use a heavily customized buildsystem based on buildroot2 from the uclibc project.
!OpenWrt uses official GNU/Linux kernel sources (2.4.30) and only add patches for the system on chip
and drivers for the network interfaces. The developer team try to reimplement most of the proprietary
code inside the GPL tarballs of the different vendors. There are free tools for writing new firmware
images directly into the flash (mtd), for configuring the wireless lan chip (wlcompat/wificonf) and to
program the VLAN capable switch (robocfg). The codename of the first !OpenWrt release is "White Russian"
a popular cocktail. !OpenWrt 1.0 is planned for the end of 2005.
