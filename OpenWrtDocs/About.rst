= About OpenWrt =
OpenWrt's design philosophy is to not lock the user down to a particular set of features but instead to provide a flexible framework that can be expanded by others. Instead of trying to cram every possible feature into one firmware, OpenWrt provides only a minimal set of features within the firmware itself, but with a writable filesystem and support for add-on packages. Using packages, users can install only the features that they need without wasting space on features that aren't used and developers can write software in the form of packages instead of writing and supporting an entire firmware.

= Why should I run OpenWrt? =
The short answer - don't. If you haven't got the slightlest clue what OpenWrt is then maybe you shouldn't be running it.
