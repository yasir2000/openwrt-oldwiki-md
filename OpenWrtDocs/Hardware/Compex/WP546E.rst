''__(This page is at an early stage of development. Please feel free to update) __''

The Compex WP54 is a small, well-made device with two Ethernet ports and Atheros wireless that support both, Compex firmware and Open-WRT Firmware.

There are several different versions are available for WP54 and only 2 type of WP54 is supporting Open-WRT. It is '''''WP54-6B '''''and''''' WP54-6E''''' ''(New Version)''.



'''__Compex WP54 ''That Support Open-''WRT.__'''

 * '''''WP54-6B''''' = more likely same as WP54-1B board, but this board with ROHS standard is support Open-WRT.
 * '''''WP54-6E''''' = The Latest WP54 Model That support Open-WRT run in IEEE802.3af standard PoE and Compex PoE Plus. It is also [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROHS ROHS] standard. This model support both Compex and Open-WRT Firmware.


'''__Compex WP54 THAT ''DO NOT'' SUPPORT Open-WRT (Normal function).__'''

 * '''WP54 1A''' = Standard Wireless device that able to run in 7Modes(AP,Client, P to P, Gateway, P to multiple P,WL Routing Client and WL Adapter)
 * '''WP54 1B''' =''' '''can be powered either by 5V DC Supply or 802.3af PoE, using a jumper selection available on the board.
 * '''WP54 1C''' = Wireless Device that support [http://wiki.openwrt.org/AccessPoint Access Point] Mode and Client mode only.
 * '''WP54 1D''' = can be powered either via a separate 24V DC PSU or a proprietary 24V DC PoE injector or real 802.3af PoE.
 * '''WP54 6D''' = It is [http://wiki.openwrt.org/applets/FCKeditor/editor/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROHS ROHS] Standard and able to run in IEEE802.3af standard PoE and Compex PoE Plus.
