= 3Com 3CRWDR100A-72 =
The device is based on Texas Instrument AR7, so you need the ["AR7Port"] in OpenWrt trunk.

= Basic hardware info =
The device has the following connectors on the rear (left to right).

 * Auxiliary antenna.
 * ADSL input connector.
 * Power connector (12V 1.2A).
 * Reset button.
 * Large On/Off button.
 * 4 numbered RJ45 10/100 MBit connectors.
 * Main antenna.

== Main processor ==
The main processor is a [http://www.ti.com Texas Instruments] [http://focus.ti.com.cn/pdfs/bcg/ar7wi_fact_sheet.pdf TNETD7300AGDW] Processor, an AR7 that should work with the ["AR7Port"] of openWRT (yet untested).

== Memory ==
Onboard is a [http://www.psc.com.tw/english/index.jsp PSC] A2V28S40BTP SDRAM Memory chip.

== Flash ==
The flash chip is an [http://www.intel.com/ Intel] TE28F160C3-B 16Mbit (2MiB) 3.0V Flash memory.

== Switch chip ==
The internal switch is a [http://www.marvell.com/ Marvell] [http://www.marvell.com/products/switching/linkstreet/LinkStreet_88E6060.pdf 88E6060-RCJ] 6-port (4 external, 1 to the router itself, 1 unused) 10/100 switch with autosensing.

== Wireless card ==
The wireless chip in mini-pci card is a [http://www.ti.com Texas Instruments] [http://focus.ti.com/lit/ml/splt139a/splt139a.pdf TNETW1130GVF], also known as ACX111 chipset.

= Serial console =
A serial console can be connected to J4.

The serial signals are at a 3.3V level, so you need to use a level convertor, see ["OpenWrtDocs/Customizing/Hardware/Serial Console"]

The serial signal itself is 115200 baud, 8 databits, 1 stopbit, no parity (8N1).

The pinout for the serial is

To enable JTAG functionality, you must short-circuit SHORT pins or put 100R resistor. (At your own risk)

I couldn't write (nor read properly) my flash because I suspect it was broken. But not sure.

But AR7 prom's was read properly.

The AR7 chip has a small memory banks on the chip : 4Kb PROM (@0xBFC00000) and 4Kb RAM (@0x80000000)

The FLASH is located at 0x90000000 (CS0) and RAM is located at 0x94000000 (CS1)
