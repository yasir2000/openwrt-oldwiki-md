= Description =

The Dell !TrueMobile 2300 is based on the BCM4710 SoC, a Mini-PCI BCM43XX
radio and a BCM5325 switch.  In many respects it is similar to the
[:OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Linksys/WRT54G: Linksys WRT54G] v1.  Like most
BCM4710-based platforms the stock firmware is Linux-based. The device
also contains the defacto standard of 4MiB Flash and 16MiB RAM.

= Installing OpenWrt =

The initial installation of OpenWrt is accomplished by uploading a
.trx image through the Dell firmware.  Once OpenWrt is installed
it is a good idea to set the ''boot_wait'' NVRAM variable to ''on''.

= Serial port? =

It is unknown if a serial header exists on this model.  There is an
unpopulated header near the Flash IC that may contain JTAG and/or
serial lines.  Further investigation will be required.
