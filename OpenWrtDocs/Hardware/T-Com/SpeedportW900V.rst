This page is Work In Progress, speak to jb24 on #openwrt and #ar7 on freenode for more info.

Others users known to have this device:  jb24

== Hardware Info ==

Uses TI AR7 chipset, onboard wireless lan, a very nice amount of ram (32MB) and flash (8MB) making it a great device to run OpenWRT on!

Being an AR7 device it also has a built-in ADSL Modem, the Speedport W900V also features as ISDN socket and two telephone sockets for VoIP use.

CPU: TNETD7200ZDW (AR7) @211Mhz 
Flash: 8 MB 
Ram: 32 MB 
WLan Chip: TNETW1350A
Ethernet Switch Chip: Infineon ADM6996LC 

It also has a single 3.3v serial port, the original T-Com firmware allows you shell access with no password to the device though the serial port.

== Bootloader ==

The bootloader is ADAM2 which provides a console on the serial port and allows flashing via FTP.  The W701V's bootloader's default IP address is 192.168.178.1, you should be able to ping it on that address a second or two after the device is rebooted.  If not reset the device back to it's defaults using the reset button on the back (see tcom's site for info on how to do this).  My router came with a very recent edition, v1.203, from February 2007.
