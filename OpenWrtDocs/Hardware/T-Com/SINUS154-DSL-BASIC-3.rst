= T-Com Sinus 154 DSL Basic 3 =

The device is based on Texas Instrument AR7, so you need the [:AR7Port]
in OpenWrt trunk.

In addition, patches which support the BRN bootloader are needed.

Currently, the kernel runs, Ethernet works, but there is no open source
based WLAN driver. So this is definitely work in progress...

== Hardware ==

This router is nearly identical to [:OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/T-Com/SINUS154-DSL-BASIC-SE].

It has only one external antenna, and the WLAN is not a separate mini-PCI board
but soldered on the main PCB.
