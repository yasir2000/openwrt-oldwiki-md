= T-Com Sinus 154 DSL Basic 3 =

The device is based on Texas Instrument AR7, so you need the [:AR7Port]
in OpenWrt trunk.

See [:OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/T-Com/SINUS154-DSL-BASIC-SE] for the current status
of  OpenWrt for this router.

== Emulation ==

The router firmware also runs with the MIPS emulator QEMU.
See http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=5488 for details.

== Hardware ==

This router is nearly identical to [:OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/T-Com/SINUS154-DSL-BASIC-SE].

It has only one external antenna, and the WLAN is not a separate mini-PCI board
but soldered on the main PCB.
