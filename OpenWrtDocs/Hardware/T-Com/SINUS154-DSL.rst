The device is based on Texas Instrument AR7, so you need the [:AR7Port]
in OpenWrt trunk.

In addition, patches which support the BRN bootloader are needed.
You will get them from http://ar7-firmware.berlios.de/.

Currently, the kernel runs, Ethernet works, but there is no open source
based WLAN driver. So this is definitely work in progress...

== Hardware ==

This router is nearly identical to [:OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/T-Com/SINUS154-DSL-BASIC-3].

But has a USB Port and different miniPCI WLAN card. (See Image...)
