The device is based on Texas Instrument AR7, so you need the ["AR7Port"] in OpenWrt trunk.

In addition, patches which support the BRN bootloader are needed. You might get them from http://ar7-firmware.berlios.de/, but the device is not listed as officially supported.

Status: untested

''TODO:'' The TableOfHardware entry misses the FLASH ROM size, RAM size (might be wrong), USB Version and requires a general confirmation by someone more with more experience than me. Also is this model really supported by the ["AR7Port"] project ?


== Hardware ==
This router is nearly identical to ["OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/T-Com/SINUS154-DSL-BASIC-3"].

But has a USB Port and different miniPCI WLAN card which can not be seen on the image due to glue. After removing the glue the Chip desc reads ISL 3880 IK.
