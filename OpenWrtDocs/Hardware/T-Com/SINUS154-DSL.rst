The device is based on Texas Instrument AR7, so you need the ["AR7Port"] in OpenWrt trunk.

In addition, patches which support the BRN bootloader are needed. You will get them from http://ar7-firmware.berlios.de/.

Currently, the kernel runs, Ethernet works, but there is no open source based WLAN driver. So this is definitely work in progress...

''TODO:'' The TableOfHardware entry misses the FLASH ROM size, RAM size (might be wrong), USB Version and requires a general confirmation by someone more with more experience than me.

== Hardware ==
This router is nearly identical to ["OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/T-Com/SINUS154-DSL-BASIC-3"].

But has a USB Port and different miniPCI WLAN card.
