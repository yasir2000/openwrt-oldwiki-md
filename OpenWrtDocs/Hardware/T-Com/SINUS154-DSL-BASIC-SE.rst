The device is based on Texas Instrument AR7, so you need the [:AR7Port]
in OpenWrt trunk.

In addition, patches which support the BRN bootloader are needed.
You will get them from http://ar7-firmware.berlios.de/.

Since Linux 2.6.19.2 for AR7, the kernel runs, Ethernet works (with minor problems),
WLAN works (with free ACX111 driver).

Nevertheless this is still work in progress...

See http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=5488 for details.
