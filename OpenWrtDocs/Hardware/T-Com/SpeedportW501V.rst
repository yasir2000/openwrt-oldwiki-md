= T-Com Speedport W501V =

== Status ==
Wifi: no support for the TNETW1350A, it's a chip with features somewhere between the supported TNETW1150 and the TNETW1450 though. ADSL: working, Ethernet: working (buggy at high load), LEDs: untested, Serial Port: working.

== Hardware Info ==

Uses TI AR7 chipset, onboard wireless lan, a very nice amount of ram (32 MiB?, check) and flash (8 MiB?, check) making it a great device to run OpenWRT on!

Being an AR7 device it also has a built-in ADSL Modem, the Speedport W501V also features two telephone sockets for VoIP use.

CPU: TNETD7200ZDW (AR7) @211Mhz, Flash: 8 MiB, Ram: 32 MiB, WLan Chip: TNETW1350A.

It also has a single 3.3v serial port, the original T-Com firmware allows you shell access with no password to the device though the serial port.

The hardware and the original firmware comes from AVM.

== Bootloader ==

The bootloader is ADAM2 which provides a console on the serial port and allows flashing via FTP.  The W501V's bootloader's default IP address is 192.168.178.1, you should be able to ping it on that address a second or two after the device is rebooted.  If not reset the device back to it's defaults using the reset button on the back (see tcom's site for info on how to do this).
