The !PowerStation2 is a versatile open architecture 802.11 based outdoor wireless platform that can be used as an AP, Bridge, PMP Station, Mesh networking client, and in many more applications being developed. It features exceptional radio and antenna design which allows links to be established over distances of 50km and can provide significantly increased throughput (up to 50+Mbps TCP/IP) over other solutions in comparable environments. Additionally, Ubiquiti has made public Linux SDK and toolchain resources for developers.

The board under the hood is the same as the [wiki:OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Ubiquiti/LiteStation2 LiteStation2]. The weather resistant housing features Adaptive Antenna Polarity Technology. Traditionally, when deploying outdoor antennas, the polarization is fixed for either vertical or horizontal operation with each have it's advantages. Ubiquiti introduces a patent-pending technology which enables fixed use or "adaptively switched" on the fly use of the same antenna in multiple polarities.
