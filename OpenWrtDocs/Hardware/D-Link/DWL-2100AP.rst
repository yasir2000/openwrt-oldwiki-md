== Interfaces ==

=== Serial ===

JP1 (12-pin, without headers) seems to be the serial port.  Probably wired the same as in the [:OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Netgear/WGT624: Netgear WGT624], which is an AR231'''2''' design.

=== JTAG ===

J1 (14-pin, without headers) seems to be the JTAG port.  Probably standard EJTAG 2.6 layout.
