 * crazy wishlist! imagine i have multiple set of wl500g. each one of them connect to the internet using gprs/cdma/usb modem. all wl500g which already have their own internet connection... imagine all wl500g connect to each other to join the internet connection as if they're one connection so the whole bandwidht is the sum of all wl500g. this will create a great redundancy and load balancing. you have to bring down all wl500g to kill the internet connection. imagine...
 * can someone make this a reality...
