The AVM 7141 has 32MB memory/8MB flash.

Similar to 7170, but lacking the ISDN telephone port.
There's 1 Ethernet port instead of a 4-ports switch.
["OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/AVM/FRITZ!Box WLAN 7170"]

Kamikaze revision 14768 works on this router.
EVA firmware should be ftp'ed to flash it.

Kernel configuration should disable 2nd serial port and TI Vlynq.
