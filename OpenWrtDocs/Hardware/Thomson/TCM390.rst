The Thomson '''TCM390''' is a cable modem based on Broadcom BCM3348 chip. It has no wireless capabilities, and provides just USB slave and Ethernet connectivity.
It is compatible with DOCSIS and EuroDOCSIS standards.

= Hardware description =
Opening the box is very easy, just two screws and no clip to pop nor seal to break. 
The board is labelled ACM6048EB rev 1.02, with CE and FCC logos and "made in Taiwan" mention.

 *Main Chip : Broadcom QAMLinkÂ® BCM3348KPB w/ 24MHz quartz, which may indicate 192MHz or 240MHz operation
 *RAM : 8MB SDRAM (Nanya [http://www.nanya.com/e-htm/page3/data/NT5SV4M16DT.pdf NT5SV4M16DT-6K])
 *Flash : 4MB (AMD/Spansion [http://www.spansion.com/products/Am29DL323G.html AM29DL323GB-90EI])
 *Cable Tuner : Broadcom BCM3415KQTE (with a heatsink)

The board has several pin headers soldered, and two of them ar labelled as UART on the silkscreen.

 *J-UART has 4 pins : pin 1 = Vcc(3V3), pin2 = Tx, pin3 = Rx, pin4 = GND
 *JP-UART2 has 4 pins : pin 1 = Rx, pin2 = Tx, pin3 = GND, pin4 = Vcc(3V3)
 *J22 has 8 pins, unknown usage.
 *J201 has 10 pins, and may be a JTAG connector (with all even-numbered pins tied to GND). According to http://lauterbach.com/admips3.gif and an ohmmeter, we can suppose pin1 = /TRST, pin3 = TDI, pin5 = TDO, pin7 = TMS, pin9 = TCK and all others are GND.
 *J1 has 2 pins, unknown usage. Looks like a jumper header, but both pins show 0V on the voltmeter.

A second Flash footprint (TSOP48) linked to the used one is available, and according to the BCM3348 product brief (the only publicly-available documentation of this chip) the EBI bus which hosts the Flash is PCMCIA compatible. Therefore, an hardware hack may consist of hooking peripherals on this bus.

= Serial access =
At bootup, a serial console (115200 baud, 8N1 Ansi) connected to UART1 connector thru a MAX232 interface, shows the following messages :

Obviously, the two images in Flash are the same : identical CRC, size and buil time.
Entering '1', '2', or 'p' within 2 seconds seems to have no action.

UART2 seems to be directly connected to UART1, as it delivers the same bootup messages and ohmmeter test shows pin-to-pin connection. It may just be a different pinout for the same signals.
