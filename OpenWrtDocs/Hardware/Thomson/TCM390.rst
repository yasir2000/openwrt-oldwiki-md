The Thomson '''TCM390''' is a cable modem based on Broadcom BCM3348 chip. It has no wireless capabilities, and provides just USB slave and Ethernet connectivity.
It is compatible with DOCSIS and EuroDOCSIS standards.

= Hardware description =
Opening the box is very easy, just two screws and no clip to pop nor seal to break.

 *Main Chip : Broadcom QAMLinkÂ® BCM3348KPB w/ 24MHz quartz, which indicates 192MHz or 240MHz operation
 *RAM : 8MB SDRAM (Nanya NT5SV4M16DT-6K)
 *Flash : 4MB (AMD/Spansion AM29DL323G B-90EI
 *Cable Tuner : Broadcom BCM3415KQTE (with a heatsink)

The board has several pin headers soldered, and two of them ar labelled as UART on the silkscreen.

 *J-UART has 4 pins : pin 1 = Vcc(3V3), pin2 = Tx, pin3 = Rx, pin4 = GND
 *JP-UART2 has 4 pins : pin 1 = Rx, pin2 = Tx, pin3 = GND, pin4 = Vcc(3V3)
 *J22 has 8 pins, unknown usage
 *J201 has 10 pins, and may be a JTAG connector (with all even-numbered pins tied to GND)
 *J1 has 2 pins, unknown usage

At bootup, a serial console (115200 baud, 8N1 Ansi) connected to UART1 connector, shows the following messages :

Obviously, the two images in Flash are the same : identical CRC, size and buil time.
Entering '1', '2', or 'p' within 2 seconds seems to have no action.
