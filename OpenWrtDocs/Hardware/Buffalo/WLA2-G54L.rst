'''Buffalo WLA2-G54L'''

The WLA2-G54L is based on the Broadcom 4712 board. It has a 200MHz CPU, 4Mb flash and 16Mb RAM.
The wireless NIC is integrated to the board. boot_wait is on by default.

Please keep in mind that for now we can't control the leds.

Pre-built Whiterussian RC4 binaries don't work with new revisions of WLA2-G54L due different flash chip. Builds with fix https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/115 do work.
