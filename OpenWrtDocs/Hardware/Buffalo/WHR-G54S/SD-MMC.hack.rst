'''Step 1: Disassemble your access point'''

----
Power off your device, open your access point, remove case, antenna, and get your MoBo on a table, Locate on the back 6 points where you should solder some wires, you'll need to locate these points:

 * VCC from AP for SD card
 * GND from AP for SD card
 * Data In (using GPIO 5)
 * Data Out (using GPIO6)
 * Clock (using GPIO3)
 * C/S (using GPIO7)
Do not use GPIO 4 as i've already explained on WHR wiki page (Buffalo uses it for reset) Please see mine already hacked (quite good hack quality, poor photo).
