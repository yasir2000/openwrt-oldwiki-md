Buffalo WLA-G54C AirStation 54Mbps Wireless Compact Repeater Bridge-g

Internally it has a Mini-PCI card (Part # WLI-MPCI-G54). The PCI card has a Broadcom BCM4306KFB chip on it. Main CPU is BCM4702KPB Memory looks like a pair of DYNACHIPS D98SD6416AH-6.

There are a couple of other chips under the Mini-PCI card.

The wireless is hooked up to 2 antennas. One in vertical polarity the other in horizontal polarity. The antenna on the top of the unit can be bypassed and connected to an external antenna. The socket is hidden under a little rubber plug on the back of the unit.

2 LED's. Oddly enough, they are labeled LED2 (Wireless) and LED3 (Ethernet).

Unit also has a pushbutton switch labeled INIT

Another important note is that there is room for a 20-pin header on the board. It is labeled J25. There are no pins, but a header would be easily mounted, as the holes are already drilled through the PCB. There is a ground wire from the Mini-PCI card already soldered into one of the holes. Don't know if this could be used for JTAG and/or serial, but it defintely has traces from some of the 'pins' to other components on the board. However, those components are under the Mini-PCI card.

Fllowing is the room for 20-pin header, it connect to the 4M Byte flash directly,but only address line of A0 TO A3 is connected. "NC" is means that it can be measured.

Who can make suggestions to repair WLA-G54C throught this 20-pin heater.
