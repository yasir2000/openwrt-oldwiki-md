Buffalo WLA-G54C AirStation 54Mbps Wireless Compact Repeater Bridge-g

Internally it has a Mini-PCI card (Part # WLI-MPCI-G54).
The PCI card has a Broadcom BCM4306KFB chip on it.
Main CPU is BCM4702KPB Memory looks like a pair of DYNACHIPS D98SD6416AH-6.
 There are a couple of other chips under the Mini-PCI card, but I didn't de-solder it to look under.
The wireless is hooked up to 2 antennas. One in vertical polarity the other in horizontal polarity.
 The antenna on the top of the unit can be bypassed and connected to an external antenna. The socket is hidden under a little rubber plug on the back of the unit.
