'''Buffalo WLA-G54'''

The wireless NIC is a mini-PCI. `boot_wait` is on by default.

'''FIX ME /!\ this paragraph needs updating'''[[BR]]
This unit should work out-of-the-box with the current CVS version of OpenWrt. Keep in mind, that the driver detects eth1 (the WAN port) too, but as it isn't wired out, You can't use it.

/!\ '''This router sits on 192.168.11.1 during boot_wait, so You have to TFTP to that address.'''
