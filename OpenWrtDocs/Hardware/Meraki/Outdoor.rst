The Meraki Outdoor (FCCID:UDX-MERAKI-OTDR) is a variant of the Meraki Mini with a weather sealed enclosure, two ethernet ports and a more powerful 200 mW radio.  The system is built on a Atheros AR2317.

The stock firmware includes some kind of watchdog.  Five minutes after power up, unless the watchdog starts, the system reboots.  To run a vanilla OpenWrt without periodic reboots, it would seem that either the reset needs to be disabled, or an alternate watchdog needs to poke the right thing.  It is not presently clear what the right thing is.

Meraki has released the source code to its RedBoot [http://dl.meraki.net/linux/redboot-ap61.tar.gz here].
