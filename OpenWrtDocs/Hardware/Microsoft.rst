'''Microsoft hardware notes'''

The only Microsoft router capable to run OpenWrt is the MN-700, but You have to use JTAG to flash a new bootloader first. More info about this can be found [http://wl500g.info/showthread.php?t=1616 here].
To use RS232 you need to install a 16550 on the pads under the board, the J8 header, a crystal, some resistors and capacitors (SMD).
