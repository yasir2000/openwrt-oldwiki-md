= Installing OpenWrt with RedBoot =

Get a TFTP server for your computer.

WBD-500 can be loaded with the same OpenWrt firmware as [:OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Fon/Fonera:Fonera] device. You have to download two files (right click and save as):

 * [http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/7.09/atheros-2.6/openwrt-atheros-2.6-vmlinux.lzma openwrt-atheros-2.6-vmlinux.lzma]
 * [http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/7.09/atheros-2.6/openwrt-atheros-2.6-root.squashfs openwrt-atheros-2.6-root.squashfs]

Copy openwrt-atheros-2.6-vmlinux.lzma and openwrt-atheros-2.6-root.squashfs to your TFTP server's root directory (usually called tftpboot).

Configure your local computer's IP address to 192.168.2.254. 

Type the command to connect to the !RedBoot bootloader, but do not press Enter yet:
{{{
telnet 192.168.2.66 9000
}}}
Power on the WBD-500 board and press Enter at the moment Ethernet LED lights up (after about 10 sec.).
Because timeslot for this is short, you might need several tries. As soon as you see the !RedBoot prompt, press Ctrl-C.
If you are using Linux, Ctrl-C might not work at first, this is because telnet requires LINEMODE option to be enabled.
You can enable this option by creating a file ~/.telnetrc with the following contents:
{{{
192.168.2.66 9000
        mode line
}}}
