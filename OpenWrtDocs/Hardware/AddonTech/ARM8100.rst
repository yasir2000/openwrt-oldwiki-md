= Addon-Tech ARM8100 =
The [http://www.addon-tech.com AddonTech] [http://www.addon-tech.com/arm8100.html ARM8100] is a TI AR7-based device. Thus ["AR7Port"] is compatible with these devices.

The Netcomm NB5Plus4 router appears to run very similar firmware,  there appear to be many Austrailian Netcomm customers with the NB5Plus4 hardware.

Older versions of the NB5Plus4 router have the same web interface as the ARM8100 router owned by Hydra which has software versions as follows:

{{{
Gateway T340A.041109a1_03
ATM Driver 4.02.04.00
DSL HAL 3.00.06.00
DSL Datapump 3.00.06.00
PDSP Firmware 0.49
Boot Loader 0.22.03
}}}
The Addon-Tech ARM8100 has an ADAM2 bootloader, (see below for logs, etc) which can be used to flash the onboard flash ram and perform other tasks.  For a great introduction and overview of ADAM2 read [http://www.seattlewireless.net/ADAM2 this page]

== Hardware Info ==
Uses TI AR7 chipset, no-onboard wireless lan, however there is space on the pcb for a mini-pci socket.

8MB Ram, 2Mb Flash, 4x 10/100 RJ45 Ports, ADSL2 RJ45 connector, Reset button, 7 led's, serial and jtag ports - with pin headers! Requires 12v PSU.  Serial port has 3.3v output too which has no problems powering a MAX 3222 chip.

== Original Firmware Info ==
The original firmware on these devices has trouble keeping track of lots of connections, for example if you use something like The All Seeing Eye to ping a bunch of game servers eventually you won't be able to make any more new connections, existing tcp connections continue to function.  After a while it goes back to normal.  The DNS server actually stops working completly when this happens however.

Additionally XBox Live reports the router as having "Moderate" NAT which means it's not very good for use with XBox Live.

uPnP support appears to be non functional.  Enabling it doesn't do anything, it looks like libpthread is missing (attemping to manually start it results in an error message)

== Backing up original firmware ==
You can telnet to the device, login as "root" with whatever passyou use used for the admin interface, or use the console via the serial port.

You can then dump each mtd block to a file and download them via a web browser pointed to the router at port 1080 using the example below.

{{{
dd if=/dev/mtdblock/0 of=/var/tmp/mtd0-squashfs.bin
dd if=/dev/mtdblock/1 of=/var/tmp/mtd1-kernel.bin
dd if=/dev/mtdblock/2 of=/var/tmp/mtd2-adam2.bin
dd if=/dev/mtdblock/3 of=/var/tmp/mtd3-adam2-nvram.bin
/usr/sbin/thttpd -g -d /var -u root -p 1080
}}}
You'll probably have to do mtd0 seperately as there's not enough free ram to dump them all and download them at the same time.  I (Hydra) actually had to kill the admin web server and a couple of other running programs before there was enough free ram to allow thttp to open the file and transfer it after mtd0.bin had been created!

Physical order of partitions on flash chip is:

mtd2,mtd1,mtd0,mtd3

== Installing OpenWrt ==
Looking at the output of the old firmware's {{{cat /proc/mtd file}}} we can see the erase size is 64k (0x10000):

{{{
mtd0: 00160000 00010000 "mtd0"
mtd1: 00080000 00010000 "mtd1"
}}}
Next, by looking at the output of {{{cat /proc/ticfg/env}}} we can see the sizes of the mtd blocks that contain the kernel ({{{mtd0}}}) and the squashfs image ({{{mtd1}}})

{{{
mtd1    0x90010000,0x90090000
mtd0    0x90090000,0x901f0000
}}}
We need to create a new mtd block {{{mtd4}}} that spans both the kernel and the filesystem: 0x90010000 - 0x901f0000.

The size of this mtd block is 1,966,080 bytes - just under 2MB.  Not a lot of room!

We check the output of {{{cat /proc/ticfg/env again}}} and see that {{{ my_ipaddress    192.168.100.1 }}} is set.  Reboot the router an within the 5 seconds connect to the ADAM2 ftp server on 192.168.100.1.  If you have a serial cable you can also reboot the router and press a key to get the router to wait in the ADAM2 console so that you have more time to connect via ftp to it.

The login name and password for the ftp server is {{{adam2}}} (lower case).

After connecting via FTP issue the command:

{{{quote SETENV mtd4,0x90010000,0x901f0000}}}

The router should respond with:

{{{200 SETENV command successful}}}

Now you can flash with the firmware of your choice.  I (Hydra) downloaded openwrt from the svn repos and built a stock flash image which was created by the build process as {{{trunk/bin/openwrt-ar7-2.4-squashfs.bin}}}  The JFFS images were also created but the filesize of them was greater than the size of the {{{mtd4}}} block so I decided not to risk it.  The JFFS image to use would be the one with the 64k erase size, e.g. {{{openwrt-ar7-2.4-jffs2-64k.bin}}}.

I flashed the firmware by issue the following commands:

{{{
quote MEDIA FLSH
binary
put /home/hydra/openwrt/svn/trunk/bin/openwrt-ar7-2.4-squashfs.bin "openwrt-ar7-2.4-squashfs.bin mtd4"
quote REBOOT
bye
}}}
So the entire process looked like this

{{{
hydra@hydra02:~$ ftp 192.168.100.1

ftp> quote REBOOT
221-Thank you for using the FTP service on ADAM2.
221 Goodbye.
ftp> quit
}}}
There is a pause before the file is transferred where the router erases the mtd4 block.  If you have a serial cable attached you can see the output in the adam2 console.

After the file is transferred there is another pause while the image file is flashed to the chip, don't reboot your router during this time.  I (hydra) was watching the output on the serial console and didn't notice if control returned to the ftp client before flashing had finished, so wait about 1 minute if you're doing this without a serial cable attached.

My router then rebooted into adam2 and then into openwrt, the entire log from the serial console was as follows:

== Getting the ADSL Working via PPPoA ==

As I (Hydra) live in the UK and my ISP uses PPPoA the only thing I can test is PPPoA, other people have tested PPPoE and found it to work.

At this time I'm currently unaware of how to correctly config /etc/config/network and/or any other scripts to automate the connection, hopefully someone can help me with this.

Trying to find out what pppd settings to use for a PPPoA connection via way of google searches was impossible.  There appear to be loads of PPPoA HOWTO's out there but they are all very old none of them seem to go into any details about the pppd parameters.

To find out what pppd settings I needed I reflashed back to my old router's firmware, then I reset my router back to it's default settings and the only thing i changed in it's config was the pppoa username and password, after which it connected itself to the internet ok.  I then used telnet to connect to the router.  I than ran {{{ps}}} to find the pid of the {{{pppd}}} program.  After I'd found the pid, (say, 374) I then would have just done {{{strings /proc/374/cmdline}}} but alas the firmware on my router didn't have strings installed.  So I went {{{cat /proc/374/cmdline > /var/tmp/pppdcmdline.bin}}} and created a webserver on the router so i could download the via http, port 8080 - {{{httpd -p 8080 -d /var/tmp}}} and then finally examine the file on a box equipped with either a hex editor or the "strings" program.

The output from strings with the default PPPoA settings was as follows
{{{
hydra@hydra02:~/arm8100$ strings pppd-cmdline.bin
/usr/sbin/pppd
plugin
pppoa
0.38
user
me@myisp
password
mypassword
nodetach
defaultroute
usepeerdns
1500
maxfail
vc-encaps
lcp-echo-failure
lcp-echo-interval
}}}

This was when using PPPoA over VC-MUX, VCI 0, VPI 38, auto CHAP/PAP authentication.

I then changed the default settings to use LLC, CHAP authentication, dial on demand and timeout from 60 to 120 and again ran strings, here's the output from which might be useful to determine what other pppd options must be catered for in any scripts.

{{{
hydra@hydra02:~/arm8100$ strings pppd-cmdline-llcchapondemandtimeout120.bin
/usr/sbin/pppd
plugin
pppoa
0.38
user
me@myisp
password
mypassword
refuse-pap
nodetach
defaultroute
usepeerdns
1500
maxfail
llc-encaps
debug
demand
idle
}}}

I've replaced my actual login with "me@myisp" and my actual password with "mypassword" in both outputs above.

Note that there are missing numeric values for the options that numeric values, and that for some reason "mtu" wasn't shown even though it's value was.

So, using the info above I tried firing up pppd using the following command line

{{{
/usr/sbin/pppd plugin /usr/lib/pppd/2.4.3/pppoatm.so 0.38 user me@myisp password mypassword nodetach defaultroute usepeerdns mtu 1500 vc-encaps debug
}}}

Of course that Didn't work as I'd forgotten to plug the adsl cable into the back of the router.  After plugging it back in and issuing the command again i was greeted with a "device in use message", so it looks like trying to start pppd without a sync'd dsl line needs a bit more work in the cleanup, maybe there's some other options that can be set which could help.

After I rebooted and issued the command again to my utter amazement my router connected via PPPoA, here's the log:

Now, my firmware doesn't have many packages compiled in right now, and i need to figure out which ones to use too.  But at least all the hardware appears to work so far!

As a side note my router could connect to the internet ok (resolv.conf was correctly updated, too) however other machines on the lan could not so the firewall in the router (read iptables configuration) is obviously not correct, yet.
