'''Asus WL-500G Deluxe'''

The WL-500G Deluxe is based on the Broadcom 5365 board. It has a 200MHz CPU, 4Mb flash and 32Mb RAM (but only 16Mb is enabled by default).
The wireless NIC is integrated to the board, and it also has a VIA USB2.0 controller. boot_wait is on by default.

so, can openwrt fully use the usb port?
connect to webcam?
connect to gprs/cdma/usb modem?
flashdisk?
