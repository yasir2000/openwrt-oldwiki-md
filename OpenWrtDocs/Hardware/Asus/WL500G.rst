The WL-500G is based on the Broadcom 4710 board. It has a 125 MHz CPU, 4 MB flash and 16 MB RAM.

WL-500G R2.40 is based on the Broadcom BCM4702KBP. Ethernet Switch is BCM5325. It has 4 MB FLASH and 16 MB DRAM. [http://www.nag.ru/goodies/foto/wireless/asus_wl_500g/asus_wl_500g.html photos]

Another [http://wl500g.info/showthread.php?t=8 discussion] and more photos. Hmm... R2.40 which based on the BCM4333KPB.

It has an USB 1.1 port and a LPT parallel port ([http://www.attansic.com.tw/english/products/pdf/AT7601F_1.0.pdf Attansic AT761F] ). The wireless NIC is a Broadcom Mini-PCI card WL-120G.

There is '''no''' serial port connector, external NS16c550 required.

'''boot_wait''' is on by default.

The integrated switch does not support VLAN tagging.
There are two network cards integrated, one for the 4 LAN ports and one for the WAN port.

The LAN device is eth0, the WAN interface is eth1 and the WLAN interface is eth2.

To make the WL-500G distinguish between the LAN and WLAN devices, do the following:

{{{
nvram set lan_ifname=eth0
nvram commit
reboot
}}}
