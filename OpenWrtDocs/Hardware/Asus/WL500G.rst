'''Asus WL-500G'''

The WL-500G is based on the Broadcom 4710 board. It has a 125MHz CPU, 4Mb flash and 16Mb RAM.
It has an USB v1.1 Port and a parallel port. No serial port, but a JTAG interface.
The wireless NIC is a mini-PCI card. boot_wait is on by default. 
You can not configure the network switch to use different IP configurations for every LAN port.
There are two network cards integrated, one for the 4 LAN ports and one for the WAN port.
