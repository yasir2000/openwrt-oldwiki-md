'''boot_wait''' is on by default.

'''TFTP Installation notes'''

Pull the plug, press and hold the reset button, plug the device and wait until the PWR LED starts flashing slowly (almost immediately). Now release the reset button and upload the firmware by TFTP using the following commands:

TFTP commands:

{{{
tftp 192.168.1.1
tftp> binary
tftp> trace
tftp> get ASUSSPACELINK\x01\x01\xa8\xc0 /dev/null
tftp> put openwrt-xxx-x.x-xxx.trx ASUSSPACELINK
}}}

After this, wait until the PWR LED stops flashing and the device to reboot and you should be set. There's also nice shell script doing this work for you to be at http://openwrt.org/downloads/utils/flash.sh.

As an alternative (or if this installation routine doesn't do the trick for you) you can always use the ASUS Recovery tool from your utilities CD to upload your !OpenWrt firmware.

Another thing is that the Asus WL500g doesn't seem to revert to the 192.168.1.1 address when starting the bootloader, but seems to use the LAN IP address set in NVRAM, so try this address or use the recovery tool if you've got problems flashing your firmware.

'''Splitting the bridge between LAN and WLAN'''

The LAN device is eth0, the WAN interface is eth1 and the WLAN interface is eth2.
To make the WL-500G distinguish between the LAN and WLAN device, do the following:

{{{
nvram set lan_ifname=eth0
nvram commit
reboot
}}}
