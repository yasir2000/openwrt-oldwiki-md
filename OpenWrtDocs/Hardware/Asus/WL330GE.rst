== Hardware Info ==

The hardware is very similar to the [:OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Asus/WL520GU:WL-520gU] and uses the heavily integrated BCM5354 core. '''This device is not to be confused with the WL-330gE''', which is a distinctly different piece of hardware.

== Bootloader Recovery Mode ==

The device can be booted in bootloader recovery mode by powering on while holding the reset button. The power LED should flash and the router should respond to a tftp'd firmware image and pings at '''192.168.1.220'''. See [:OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Asus/Flashing:flashing Asus routers].

== Patch Info ==

Works out of the box, with the exception of the reset button. For now, you can download and apply [http://lists.openwrt.org/pipermail/openwrt-devel/2009-February/003900.html this patch] against trunk or 8.09 for proper detection and support.
