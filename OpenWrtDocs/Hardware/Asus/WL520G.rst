10 nov 2006: Kire: The normal version of openwrt is too big, too allow the passwd, to write to /etc/passwd (no jffs partition) therefore the system should be stripped down. I started from SVN revision 5473. I mainly removed the wlan-stuff to free some space. and some unnecessary modules. And then: IT WORKS. I left the status at WiP, because it does not function out of the box.
