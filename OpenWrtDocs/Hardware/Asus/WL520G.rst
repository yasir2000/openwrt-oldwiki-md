'''Asus WL-520G'''

The WL-520G is based on the Broadcom 5350 board. It has a 200MHz CPU, 2Mb flash and 8Mb RAM. The wireless NIC is integrated. In china, it's also marketed as "Asus WL-500G-X".

Jek(YauhenKharuzhy): "I probed OpenWrt 'micro broadcom squashfs' WhiteRussian image with WL520g. Out of box it doesn't works. Sometimes it replies on ping requests (1 of 10 pings), and this is all."

10 nov 2006: Kire: The normal version of openwrt is too big, too allow the passwd, to write to /etc/passwd (no jffs partition) therefore the system should be stripped down. I started from SVN revision 5473. I mainly removed the wlan-stuff to free some space. and some unnecessary modules. And then: IT WORKS. I left the status at WiP, because it does not function out of the box.
