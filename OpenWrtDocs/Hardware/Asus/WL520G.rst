'''Asus WL-520G'''

The WL-520G is based on the Broadcom 5350 board. It has a 200MHz CPU, 2Mb flash and 8Mb RAM. The wireless NIC is integrated. In china, it's also marketed as "Asus WL-500G-X".

Jek(YauhenKharuzhy): "I probed OpenWrt 'micro broadcom squashfs' WhiteRussian image with WL520g. Out of box it doesn't works. Sometimes it replies on ping requests (1 of 10 pings), and this is all."

Kire: The kernel actually starts. The init_d scripts stop because of a "data bus error", when it runs "ifconfig eth0 up". Apart from the ethernet stuff, which is somewhat important for a router, everything works on the serial console.
