Overclocking doesn't seem to be possible with the clkfreq variable but
may be underclocked

{{{
# nvram set clkfreq=150

10 nov 2006: Kire: The normal version of openwrt is too big, too allow the passwd, to write to /etc/passwd (no jffs partition) therefore the system should be stripped down. I started from SVN revision 5473. I mainly removed the wlan-stuff to free some space. and some unnecessary modules. And then: IT WORKS. I left the status at WiP, because it does not function out of the box.

16 Dec 2006 Jek(YauhenKharuzhy): Kamikadze works after customization. There are issues with small amount of memory.

18 Mar 2007 dot202: This device supports Whiterussian 0.9 micro package. wlan works as well.
