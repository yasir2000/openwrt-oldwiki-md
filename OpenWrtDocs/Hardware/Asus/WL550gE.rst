WL-550gE does not seem to be supported by WhiteRussian, yet.

After uploading WhiteRussian RC5 file "openwrt-brcm-2.4-jffs2-4MB.trx" the router is no longer reachable via any network interface. Rescue mode does not seem to work eighter :(

If any developer would like to mess with this, let me know. If a "virgin" second piece laying around here ;-)
