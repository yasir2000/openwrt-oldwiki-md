The Asus WL-550gE seems not to be supported by OpenWrt, yet.

== Flo's user report ==

After uploading WhiteRussian RC5 file "openwrt-brcm-2.4-jffs2-4MB.trx" the router is no longer reachable via any network interface. Rescue mode does not seem to work eighter :(

If any developer would like to mess with this, let me know. I have a "virgin" second piece laying around here ;-)
