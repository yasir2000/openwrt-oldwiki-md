The Asus WL-550gE is supported by OpenWrt rc6.

After uploading WhiteRussian RC5 file "openwrt-brcm-2.4-jffs2-4MB.trx" the router is no longer reachable via any network interface. Rescue mode does not seem to work eighter :(

If any developer would like to mess with this, let me know. I have a "virgin" second piece laying around here ;-)

I successfully flashed an Asus WL-550gE with openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx (rc6) and openwrt-freifunk-1.4.5.trx. The device seems to work fine, however i did not test encryption yet.

I flashed my Asus WL-550gE with openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx (whiterussian-0.9). pppoe seems to stop receiving data after several hours and requires a reconnect to get it working again.. Everything else seems to work.
