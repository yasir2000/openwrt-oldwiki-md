= Asus WL600g =
The device run linux, the firmware upgrade on [http://support.asus.com/download/download.aspx?SLanguage=en-us&model=WL-600g Asus Site] is a squashed filesystem ([http://blueangel.us/wl600g/squash download]) and some other data appended to it (a kernel?)

The squashfs is 2.0 but it uses an unknown compression method so only file listing is possible.

{{{
$ file squash squash: Squashfs filesystem, big endian, version 2.0, 2664561 bytes, 678 inodes, blocksize: 65536 bytes, created: Thu Jul 20 10:32:10 2006
}}}
Tryng to read files gives the following error in syslog:

{{{
SQUASHFS error: lzma returned unexpected result 0x1
}}}
The stock firmware seems to run a 2.6.8.1 kernel and a bounch of other binary modules are in /lib, see the [http://blueangel.us/wl600g/wl600g.files File Listing] for detail
