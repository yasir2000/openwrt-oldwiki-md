This device is currently (January 2007) unsupported. XScale port is in progress, but is not based on Intel codebase and therefore VoIP FXS ports won't be supported. Otherwise adding support should be fairly easy.

Stock firwmare is based on Linux 2.6.14.2 and Busybox. Device is designed by Swedish company named Teleca tse AB. XScale CPU is located on separate processor board. There's plenty of unpopulated connectors onboard so JTAG is likely present. VoIP interface is done using Myson Century chip and probably connected to XScale CPU using Intel's Utopia interface. Myson firmware is stored on onboard flash in separate partition. Bootloader is Redboot.
