= Netgear DG834N =
As of today there are two versions of this router/modem known as DG834N and DG834Nv2. According to the [http://kbserver.netgear.com/kb_web_files/n101777.asp official information] the differences are:
 * DG834Nv2 has added a pushbutton on the front panel for Wi-Fi Protected Setup, also referred to as “Push “N” Connect”.
 * DG834Nv2 LEDs have been redefined
Both models use the same firmware.
