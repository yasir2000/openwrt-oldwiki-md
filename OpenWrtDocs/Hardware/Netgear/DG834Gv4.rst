== Hardware ==
According to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DG834G Wikipedia], not based anymore on TI AR7, but Broadcom. Confirmed by image below.

 * BCM6348 V0.7 cpu @ 239.20 bogomips
 * Broadcom BCM4318 802.11 Wireless Controller
 * Broadcom BCM6348B0 Ethernet Network Device v0.3
 * Linux version 2.6.8.1 (gcc version 3.4.2)
Doesn't have /proc/sys/dev/adam2/, so might not be adam2 based bootloader?
