I wanted to buy a prolific USB to serial cellphone cable at ebay, but they sent me an Silicon Labs cable, but this chipset is finaly supported in 2.6.12. Works great (usb 2-1.2: CP2101 converter now attached to ttyUSB0)

Set your serial terminal (i.e. minicom) to 9600 8N1, I enabled software flow control, too.
