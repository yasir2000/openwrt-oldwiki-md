Describe OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Netgear/SC101 here.

With thanks to member ulf_k/ulfkypke for starting this page, though I completely overwrote it.

== Device ==

The netgear SC101 is a two drive IDE/PATA SAN system. It is not usable as network share through FTP, SMB/CIFS or NFS, but needs a Windows installed driver to make it appear as local drive. It uses a proprietary SAN over IP technology from Zetera called ZSAN. No drivers for Linux or any other than Windows exists. The Windows drivers are quite nice and run on Vista. It can reach about 6.5MB/s.

The device supports RAID-1 but even though 2 drives are in the same box, the mirroring is done over the network, so drains the performance further. Another slightly disappointing feature is it uses its own file system. You cannot take out the drive, and use it in another housing and read the data. 

Off topic, I like the comparable Ximeta NDAS technology better: Linux support, choice of file system and better performance, but I would probably like OpenWRT even more, if it can fit in the meager 2MB/8MB. 

I found the following hardware on the board:

 *CPU      : TNETV2005ZGW (Texas Instruments) 125Mhz - MIPS
 *Flash    : 29LV160CBTC-90G (MX) 2Mbyte 
 *RAM      : EM63825TS-6G (EtronTech) 8Mbyte 
 *Power    : AIC 1084PM linear regulator, MP1583DM switched regulator 
 *Ethernet : ICS1893BF - 10/100 Ethernet PHY
 *Various logic 2x VCH245A 1x LVC244A 1x LVC32A (Philips)
 *Bootloader: PSPBoot
 *OS        : VxWorks
 *BootWait  : 3 seconds

Some infos can be found here http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/content/view/24757/75/1/1/

== Power ==
Because the 12V input of the SC101 is directly fed to the IDE/ATA drives, this device is pretty strict in the quality of power (unlike many other OpenWRT devices that have a nominal input, but in fact because of switched regulator usually run on whatever you give them) The MP1583 I suspect is a switched regulator that creates the 5V from the 12V line. Used Cap is 16V, but as stated, because of the drives I would not experiment with the input voltage. The AIC 1084 is a linear regulator that would then create the 3.3V from the 5V Actual drawn power, with no drives attached is 160 mA

== CPU ==
As stated a Texas Instruments TI TNETV2005ZGW processor at 125Mhz. I suspect it must have an onboard IDE bus, as I cannot find any other chip that would do this. A TQ25.000 crystal is located near the CPU.

Inside the firmware various IO ports are mapped to some addresses in range 0xA8610000-0xA8612800, and HDD-specific ports are mapped to some addresses in 0xBC380000-0xBC780000.

== IDE bus ==

There is in fact a single IDE port, with both its channels used for the two drives. The cable is the old 40 ribbon type with cable select punch-out hole. Note that the central header is used to connect to the print, and either end for the drives. The one with the cable select hole will be slave. 

Because a 40 pin cable is used, the drives cannot operator above UDMA 33MB. But as the LAN only has 100Mb/s, I guess a 33MB/s drive throughput is more than enough to flood the LAN. Replacing the cable with an 80 conductor one does not in any way change the performance. (I had hoped maybe it would influence the CPU overhead, for good or bad, but it seems the CPU does not notice this at all) In any case, replacing the cable with a longer one would allow folding it so that both drives can have their metal top site against the metal hull of the SC101, providing better cooling.

== Headers ==

 *SW1 reset switch 
 *J1  To power for drives and status leds (probably also 4 GPIO for LEDs) 
 *J2  IDE header (1 port, 2 channels) 
 *J3  Fan 2-pin header (missed on some design)
 *J4  Possibly 20 pin JTAG, though I cannot map even the ground connections to any known JTAG. Or 14 pin JTAG *and* Serial in a custom format ? 
 *J5: Fan 2-pin header (missed on some design).
The original SC101 prototype design did have an external fan mounted on the back end of the unit, which was removed after the SC101 went into production.

== GPIO ==

One to the SW1 obviously, and one to D2 LED on PCB (lights on after vxVorks startded). Further, there are 4 data lines going to the power/led subprint. 2 of them seem to come directly from the IDE bus, I suspect drive activity is one of them, so two would be general IO. And there are only 3 LEDs on the sub print, and one unused solder pad. There may be a free I/O

== Serial ==

On the J4 20 pin header, pin 10, 12, 14 (square pin is pin 1)
Settings 3.3v with 9600 8N1
{{{
   0V signal   1  2  3.3V signal
 3.2V signal   3  4  3.3V signal
   0V signal   5  6  3.3V signal
 3.2V signal   7  8  3.3V signal

}}}
My 3.3V phone USB serial cable had its Tx floating pulled up to 3.3V, and if I connected before powerup to pin 10 Rx, the device '''would not power up'''. I had to apply power first, then quickly connect pin 10, just in time to press Esc in the 3 second boot wait. If I was too slow, I had to wait a minute for the full VxWorks boot, and type reboot. Upon reboot, the already connected Rx did not matter.

== Bootwait, dhcp and tftp ==

There is a 3 second bootwait, and the tftp command exists in the bootloader. Dhcp is disabled by default due to BOOTCFG=m:f:"vxWorks" environment variable. Manually changing BOOTCFG=a:nf:"vxWorks" forces dhcp starts right after minimal boot completed and auto-setup IPA and IPA_GATEWAY variables according to network settings. By using tftp it is possible to store files on flash or load ELF(?)executable directly to RAM and run it.

Connector J1 leads to a sub-print that powers the drives. It is a very simply 20 pin header, with 6 pins 12V, 6 pins GND, 4 pins 5V and 4 I/O pins, driving the 3 LEDs. The sub-print seems to have 2 unused pad-pairs, one connected to the 12V line, one to the unused I/O.
