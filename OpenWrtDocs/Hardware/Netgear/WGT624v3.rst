= Netgear WGT624 v3 =
the WGT624 v3 is based on an Atheros System on a Chip (Soc). It has an AR2316A MIPS processor. There is an ongoing process porting OpenWRT to this chip: AtherosPort

== Hardware Versions ==

there appear to be multiple versions of the 'v3' router. the one described on this page is the following:

{{{
Hardware Version  	V3H1
Firmware Version 	V2.0.16_1.0.1NA
}}}

This information can be found at the top of the 'router status page' in the web interface.

It can also be found via the telnet hack (see below)

== Specs for WGT624 v3 -- HW REV V3H1 ==

 * CPU: AR2316A? NOT VERIFIED
 * Flash: 2MB Macronix 25L1605AMC
 * RAM: 8MB  Samsung K4S281632F-UC75
 * Switch: Marvell 88E6060
 * Wireless: AR5315
 * One External Antenna (2db)
 * One Internal Antenna, etched onto PCB.
 * 1 WAN-Ports
 * 4 LAN-Ports
 * Powersupply: 12VDC @1A positive tip

== Photos ==

=== HW REV V3H1 ===
Some photos are here: http://linuxpmi.org/trac/wiki/WGT624v3Pics

== Serial or JTAG ==

=== HW REV V3H1 ===
Its got an unpopulated header of some sort labeled JP1. not yet verified whether its serial or JTAG.

== Telnet ==
This unit can be telneted into via the telnetenable hack documented on [:OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Netgear/TelnetConsole].

It took me several attempts (more than a dozen) to get this to work. if it fails, you have to power cycle the router to try again.
