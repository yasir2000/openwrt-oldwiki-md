= Netgear WGT624 =
the WGT624 v3 is based on an Atheros System on a Chip (Soc). It got a ar2315? MIPS processor. There is an ongoing process porting OpenWRT to this chip: AtherosPort

== Serial ==
Its got an unpopulated header of some sort labeled JP1. not yet verified whether its serial or JTAG.

== Telnet ==
This unit can be telneted into via the telnetenable hack documented on OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Netgear/TelnetConsole.

some useful commands are:

{{{
U12H05500> wla get hardware
wlan0 revisions: mac 11.0 phy 4.8 analog 7.0
  PCI Vendor ID: 0x168c, Device ID: 0x13
  Sub Vendor ID: 0x168c, Sub Device ID: 0x13
chip is ar5315
}}}
Can anyone post a working kernel binary for the 624v1, to double check it's not a build problem? Maybe this is why the Netgear v1/v2 firmware is incompatible with the v3. Perhaps the ar531xPlus needs a different patch.
