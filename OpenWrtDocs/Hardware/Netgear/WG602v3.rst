'''Netgear WG602 v3'''

The WG602 v3 is based on the Broadcom 4712 board. It has a 200MHz CPU, 2Mb flash and 8Mb RAM, and a detachable antenna.

 * Flash: Intel TE 28F160C3 BDBD70 ([http://download.intel.com/design/flcomp/datashts/29064523.pdf datasheet], [http://download.intel.com/design/flcomp/specupdt/29793814.pdf update]): 16 Mbit

 * RAM: !EtronTech EM638425TS-6 ([http://etron.com/img/pdf/SDRAM/64Mb/2Mx32/Em638325(Rev%200.8).pdf datasheet]): 64Mbit (2M x 32) 6 ns (166 MHz) SDRAM

It has a populated UART1 connector, and un-populated UART0 and JTAG.The wireless NIC is integrated on the board. Does not appear to use boot wait. Instead the following procedure worked for recovering a dead unit and may be useful in putting new firmware on the unit:

== Recovery procedure ==
What to do if you brick it!

 1. Copy the latest firmware from Netgear to the file 'image.idts334'

 1. Power off the device and power  on while depressing the reset button for 2 seconds

 1. tftp to the box; set binary mode; and put the file image.idts334

 1. issue the 'get REBOOT' command

Eg.

 . % tftp tftp> connect 192.168.0.227 tftp> binary tftp> put image.idts334 Sent 1585152 bytes in 5.2 seconds tftp> get REBOOT
