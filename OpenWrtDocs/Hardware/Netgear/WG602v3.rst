'''Netgear WG602 v3'''

The WG602 v3 is based on the Broadcom 4712 board. It has a 200MHz CPU, 2Mb flash and 8Mb RAM.
The wireless NIC is integrated on the board. Does not appear to use boot wait. Instead the following procedure worked for recovering a dead unit and may be useful in putting new firmware on the unit:

== Recovery procedure ==

What to do if you brick it!

 1. Copy the latest firmware from Netgear to the file 'image.idts334'

 2. Power off the device and power  on while depressing the reset button for 2 seconds

 3. tftp to the box; set binary mode; and put the file image.idts334

 4. issue the 'get REBOOT' command

Eg.

 % tftp

 tftp> connect 192.168.0.227

 tftp> binary

 tftp> put image.idts334
