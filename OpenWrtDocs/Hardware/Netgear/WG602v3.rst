'''Netgear WG602 v3'''

== Hardware ==
The WG602 v3 is based on the Broadcom 4712 board. It has a 200MHz CPU, 2MB flash and 8MB RAM, and a detachable antenna.

 * Flash: Intel TE 28F160C3 BDBD70 ([http://download.intel.com/design/flcomp/datashts/29064523.pdf datasheet], [http://download.intel.com/design/flcomp/specupdt/29793814.pdf update]): 16 Mbit

 * RAM: !EtronTech EM638425TS-6 ([http://etron.com/img/pdf/SDRAM/64Mb/2Mx32/Em638325(Rev%200.8).pdf datasheet]): 64Mbit (2M x 32) 6 ns (166 MHz) SDRAM

It has a populated UART1 connector, and un-populated UART0 and JTAG.The wireless NIC is integrated on the board. Does not appear to use boot wait. Instead the following procedure worked for recovering a dead unit and may be useful in putting new firmware on the unit:

May want to follow this thread: [http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=4039 Devices with 2 MB flash]

== Recovery procedure ==
How to upload a firmware via TFTP:

 1. Download the latest firmware from Netgear. Currently (2 April 2006) it is version [ftp://downloads.netgear.com/files/wg602v3_1_0_8.trx 1.0.8-rc3].

 1. Reboot the wg602v3: power off the device and power on while pressing the reset button for 5 seconds, until the wireless activity LED starts blinking.

 1. tftp to the box, set binary mode, and upload the firmare file as {{{image.idts334}}} . You have a very limited time to do this, so it may actually work better to first issue the tftp command, and then reboot the wg602v3.

 1. If the upload is successful, the wg602v3 will program the flash and load the new firmware.

Eg. (linux)

 . {{{
$ tftp -m binary 192.168.0.227 -c put wg602v3_1_0_8.trx image.idts334 
Sent 1634304 bytes in 5.8 seconds
}}}

Eg. (windows)

 . {{{
C:\...\> tftp -i 192.168.0.227 put wg602v3_1_0_8.trx image.idts334 
Transfer successful: 1634304 bytes in 11 seconds, 148573 bytes/s
}}}

== Netgear Firmware ==
Binary firmare releases can be found on the Netgear [http://kbserver.netgear.com/products/wg602v3.asp WG602v3 support] web page:

 * [ftp://downloads.netgear.com/files/wg602v3_V1_0_4.trx 1.0.4]
 * [ftp://downloads.netgear.com/files/wg602v3_v1_0_5.zip 1.0.5]
 * [ftp://downloads.netgear.com/files/wg602v3_1_0_8.trx 1.0.8 rc3]
 * 1.1.0 for [ftp://downloads.netgear.com/files/wg602v3_1_1_0_na.trx North America] and [ftp://downloads.netgear.com/files/wg602v3_1_1_0_non_na.trx outside] 

I haven't investigated the differences between North America and non-NA versions yet.

GPL source code releases are available from the Netgear [http://kbserver.netgear.com/kb_web_files/n101238.asp GPL Open Source code] web page:

 * [ftp://downloads.netgear.com/files/GPL/wg602v3-GPL.tar.gz 1.0.4]
 * [ftp://downloads.netgear.com/files/GPL/wg602v3-GPL-v1.0.5.tgz 1.0.5]
 * [ftp://downloads.netgear.com/files/GPL/wg602v3-GPL-v1.0.6.tgz 1.0.6]
 * [ftp://downloads.netgear.com/files/GPL/wg602v3-V1.0.8RC3-GPL.tar.gz 1.0.8 rc3]
 * 1.1.0 for [ftp://downloads.netgear.com/files/GPL/wg602v3-V1.1.0NA-GPL.tar.gz North America] and [ftp://downloads.netgear.com/files/GPL/wg602v3-V1.1.0-GPL.tar.gz outside]

Some models shipped with a binary version of the 1.0.6 firmware, but such version is not available for download from the Netgear support site.

== OpenWRT ==
=== Serial console ===
This AP uses by default UART1 (/dev/ttyS1) as the console, while OpenWRT is usually configured to use UART0 (/dev/ttyS0). If you want to use the serial console on /dev/ttyS1, you need to modify the OpenWRT configuration accordingly, and rebuild. The serial port is used for two independent purposes: displaying the kernel boot messages and providing shell access to your box.

==== Pinout for the UART1 connector ====

Looking from the backside of the device the pinout of UART1 (J5) is

 * Pin 1  =  3,3V
 * Pin 2  =  RxD
 * Pin 3  =  TxD
 * Pin 4  =  Gnd

Remember that you'll need one of the well-known TTL-V24 adapters to connect UART1 to a PC.


The kernel console configuration is provided by its command line arguments, defined at configuraion time in the CONFIG_CMDLINE config variable. For White Russian, the file to modify is {{{target/linux/linux-2.4/config/brcm}}}, while for Kamikaze 2.4 it is {{{target/linux/brcm-2.4/config}}}. In both, you need to change

 . {{{
...
CONFIG_CMDLINE="root=/dev/mtdblock2 rootfstype=squashfs,jffs2 init=/etc/preinit noinitrd console=ttyS0,115200"
...
}}}

into

 . {{{
...
CONFIG_CMDLINE="root=/dev/mtdblock2 rootfstype=squashfs,jffs2 init=/etc/preinit noinitrd console=ttyS1,115200"
...
}}}

Console access to the AP can be enabled both on ttyS0 and ttyS1. The shell is started by {{{/sbin/init}}} after the kernel has booted, as configured in {{{/etc/inittab}}}. The file to modify is {{{package/base-files/default/etc/inittab}}}.

For White Russian RC5, change

 . {{{
::sysinit:/etc/init.d/rcS
tts/0::askfirst:/bin/ash --login
}}}

into

 . {{{
::sysinit:/etc/init.d/rcS
tts/1::askfirst:/bin/ash --login
}}}

For Kamikaze, change:

 . {{{
::sysinit:/etc/init.d/rcS
::shutdown:/sbin/halt
tts/0::askfirst:/bin/ash --login
#tts/1::askfirst:/bin/ash --login
}}}

into

 . {{{
::sysinit:/etc/init.d/rcS
::shutdown:/sbin/halt
#tts/0::askfirst:/bin/ash --login
tts/1::askfirst:/bin/ash --login
}}}

You can leave both entries uncommented, if for any reason you want console access on both ports.

If you have already built your firmware once, you can just edit {{{build_mipsel/root/etc/inittab}}} and do a {{{make target/install}}}. These changes however will be lost if you do a full rebuild.

=== White Russian RC5 ===
I haven't managed to get White Russian RC5+ (revision 3587) to boot properly on the WG602v3. I gat a lot of messages like

}}}
and then the kernel hangs with "no init found".

I asume the problem is in the mtd layout:
 . {{{
0x00000000-0x00040000 : "pmon"
0x00040000-0x001f0000 : "linux"
0x00000000-0x00200000 : "rootfs"
0x001f0000-0x00200000 : "nvram"
0x00000000-0x001f0000 : "OpenWrt"
}}}
The issue is in the areas assigned to the "rootfs" (the squashfs-lzma readonly filesystem) and the "OpenWrt" (the j2ffs filesystem) sections: these are definetly wrong, using the full 0x00000000-0x001f0000 area.

Also, notice that the "pmon" section (the bootloader) incorrectly takes 256kB instead of 192kB.


=== Kamikaze ===
As of revision 3603, Kamikaze appears to be very basically working. This access point have quite little RAM and flash space, so you need to srip something out of the standard image - dropbear is a good candidate, at least while setting things up.

The main rpblem at the moment is that ifconfig crashes when trying to set up eth0: the first time you'll get a bus error / segmentation fault, the second time the system hangs.

Because of thid the System V (/etc/init.d/S*) boot process doesn't complete: firstboot is never called, and the j2ffs partition never created / made active.
If you call /etc/init.d/S98done by hand to create it, and remove ifconfig from the j2ffs partition, you'll get to a working shell without issues.

Actually, you may have to remove some stuff in order to free RAM and flash space, as this access point is very limited. Anyway, you can get:
