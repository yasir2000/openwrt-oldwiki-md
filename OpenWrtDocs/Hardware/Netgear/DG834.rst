In "flash memory order" so you can use mtd1+mtd0+mtd3, from 0x90020000 to  0x903f0000 to store openwrt. Remember when creating mtd5.

Just remember to made backup if you want to came back to the original behaviour.

== And as a last resort JTAG ==
The jtag interface is on JP102 and follow the MIPS - EJTAG 2.6 14 pin connector standard. (TESTED)

I've used the buffered cable schema (wiggler) from the [:OpenWrtDocs/Customizing/Hardware/JTAG_Cable:JTAG Cable] page but i had to add a 100pF capacitor between clk and ground just after the buffer (between the buffer and the jtag interface) to avoid problem with the clock that caused DeBrick to read a wrong address and hang.
