The serial console port is on the JP603 as for V2, and the same pinout is used. However, this header is not at the same location, it is a the right side of the PCB, between the power plug and the eth4 led, and is oriented differently. I did not found any +5V to feed the ADM233LJ (pin compatible max233), so I used an external alim. Then minicom@115200,8N1 started to show the kernel output, and give a busybox console.

The console is located roughly behind the tick led on the front left of the board, just off the edge of the MiniPCI connector. It was half hidden by the MAC
address sticker on my unit. It's the only header I could find; only 4 pins and wasn't soldered up at all. I took a voltage tap of an adjacent 74xx chip to power my MAX232. Settings are 115200,8,N,1.
== PLEASE CONFIRM ADAM2 IS ONLY VERSION 2 AND UPDATE WIKI ==
== ADAM2 ==
The DG834(G) bootloader, ADAM2, calculates a checksum of the image in flash memory.  If this checksum fails, the router won't boot.  OpenWRT does not include this checksum (stored in the image), although it could be added.  [http://members.iinet.net.au/~mlanagan/] is a tool that builds custom firmware with this checksum.  The following instructions, however, disable the checksum verification.

==== Getting access to your router ====
 1. Enable debug mode (telnet access)
  * Go to the following URL in your router: http://192.168.0.1/setup.cgi?todo=debug
==== Backing things up ====
If you make a mistake, these backups are very useful.  MTD layout is listed later on the page.
 1. Telnet into your router
  {{{
telnet 192.168.1.1
}}}
 1. Backup each mtd block.
  {{{
ls /dev/mtdblock

dd if=/dev/mtdblock/2 of=/tmp/mtd2.bin
...
}}}
 1. Start a web server on your router so you can download your mtd images.
  {{{
cd /tmp
mini_httpd -p 1080
}}}
 1. Download the files you just backed up.  You can find them at http://192.168.0.1:1080/mtdX.bin.
==== Patching ADAM2 ====
'''*PLEASE NOTE THE BELOW COULD PERMANENTLY BREAK YOUR ROUTER*'''
 1. Since you're going to modify mtd2.bin, make sure you have the correct file/version.  The md5 hash of mtd2.bin is 0530bfdf00ec155f4182afd70da028c1.  If it isn't, stop.  This is for 0.18.01 as distributed by Netgear.
 2. Using a hex editor (hexedit in unix), go to offest 0x3944 in mtd2.bin.  You should see these 4 bytes: 44 09 00 0C (representing a jal 0x90002510 during execution). Replace these 4 bytes with 0 (representing nop).
 3. Confirm the new md5 hash is d8a2f4623bf6f64b7427812f0e849aa7.
==== Replacing ADAM2 ====
If your new md5sum matches up ok then you should copy the patched mtd2.bin over to the Netgear; wget is installed on it, so assuming you can put the image on a web/ftp server somewhere that shouldn't be hard. Then you can do dd if=adam2-fix.bin of=/dev/mtdblock/2 (assuming you called the patched image adam2-fix.bin) on the Netgear, which should patch the ADAM2 image. At this point you cross your fingers and hope it went ok, and restart the device. If it comes up, fantastic. If not, then you're unfortunately a bit stuck - my version of the DG834G has no obvious JTAG port and as such if the bootloader dies there's no way to get in. FWIW I've had a couple of success reports though, as well as my own attempt. Don't attempt this if you don't know what you're doing though.
== MTD Layout ==
'''Please confirm these values for yourself.  Writing over the wrong mtd block could brick your router'''
{{{
mtd0	0x900d0000,0x903e0000	RootFS
mtd1	0x90020000,0x900d0000	Kernel
mtd2	0x90000000,0x90020000	ADAM2
mtd3	0x903e0000,0x903f0000	Probably Netgear firmware config
mtd4	0x903f0000,0x90400000	Probably ADAM2 config
}}}
(Note: mtd2 precedes mtd1, which precedes mtd0, in memory mapped adresses)

The AR7 installation instructions instruct you to create mtd4, but this is already used by the DG834(G). Instead, do this in the ADAM2 FTP/Telnet server:

'''Please confirm these values for yourself.  Writing over the wrong mtd block could brick your router'''

SETENV mtd5,0x90020000,0x903e0000
}}}
