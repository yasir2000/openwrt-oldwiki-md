'''Netgear WG602 v1'''

The original version of the WG602 (sometimes known as the v1) is based on an IDT design running OpenRG. It has a 150MHz CPU, 4MB flash and 16MB RAM.
The wireless NIC is a PrismGT miniPCI card. At this time, I cannot get OpenWRT to run on it. Does not appear to use boot wait. Instead the following procedure worked for recovering a dead unit and may be useful in putting new firmware on the unit:

== Recovery procedure ==

What to do if you brick it!

 1. Set up a computer with the ip address 192.168.1.98/24.
    ip address add 192.168.1.98/24 eth0

 2. Install and configure a tftp server.
    yum install tftp-server
    chkconfig tftp on

 3. Copy the latest firmware from Netgear to the file 'image.idts334' in your tftp server's root.
    wget ftp://downloads.netgear.com/files/wg602_v1715.zip
    unzip wg602_v1715.zip
    cp WG602_V1715.img /tftpboot/image.idts334

 4. Hold in the reset button, remove and reapply power, while holding the reset button for an additional ten seconds.

 5. The WG602 should, using an IP address of 192.168.1.69/24, retrieve the firmware image from your tftp server. You can watch this activity with tcpdump or Ethereal.

Note that this procedure does not appear to work without some header information in the image.idts334 file
