== Bootloader ==

Huawei is using the CFE bootloader from Broadcom, but appear to have modified it slightly - Note the CFE reboot flags. This may or may not be to do with the soft off power support on the D100.

Unlike the ASUS routers running on the BCM5354, there is no recovery mode when the reset button is held down on power up. In the case of the D100, when the reset button is held in during power up, CFE resets the NVRAM back to factory default settings (There is a MTD partition called Factory).

Uploading firmware with a TRX header via the D100's WebGUI reports "Parsing error on the name of the uploaded file" and as this product is new at the time of writing and no firmware upgrades have yet to be released, we will probably have to wait for an upgrade file before we can work out the format.

Hence the only way to upload firmware to the D100 at present is via the console port. With a console port attached, press CTRL-C to cancel Automatic startup. If you hold the power button down on the D100, the D100 will switch off as soon as booting is interrupted. If this occurs, start pressing CTRL-C rapidly and very briefly press and release the D100's power button.

CFE clear reboot_number: reboot_flag0 = 0x12345678, reboot_flag1 = 0x0,reboot_flag2 = 0xfff0

At this point, the CFE bootloader has a recovery webpage accessible. This is probably designed to help the end user when corrupt firmware is uploaded.

However once again it doesn't accept firmware in a TRX format. 

The best way to upload your new firmware to your D100 is to pull it from a TFTP server :

{{{
CFE> flash -noheader 192.168.1.100:/openwrt-brcm47xx-squashfs.trx flash1.trx
Reading 192.168.1.100:/openwrt-brcm47xx-squashfs.trx: Done. 3215360 bytes read

*** command status = 0
CFE> reboot
}}}
