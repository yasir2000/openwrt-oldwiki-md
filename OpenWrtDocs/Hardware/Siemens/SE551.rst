Currently it seems, that boot_wait is turned off, as the device does not respond to tftp after reboot.[[BR]]
initially it is bound to 192.168.2.1.[[BR]]
It is also not possible to upload openwrt image via web interface. This aborts with an error.[[BR]]
Up to now I would consider SE551 as unsupported as there is no possibility to upload firmware to the device.[[BR]]
/!\ Find additional information on http://opossum.rat.at/~anno/SE551/

This router is identical in layout to the SMCWBR14T-G router. The only difference is that the SMC router has only 1 coil and only 3 capasitors providing less power (cheap bastards!). The USB chip and port has also gone missing. The firmware seems to be similar, but the SMC device has a slightly older Loader (v0.03, log similar device here [http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=36180])

This router seems however to have a propiertary OS instead.

You need an external level shifter IC like a MAX3232.[[BR]]
/!\ For additional safety I added a 500E resistor in line to pin 5, as I measured some voltage (3.3V), when pin not connected.
