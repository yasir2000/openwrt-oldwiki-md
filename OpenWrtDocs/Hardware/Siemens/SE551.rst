Describe OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Siemens/SE551 here.

= General =

Currently it seems, that boot_wait is turned off, as the device does not respond to tftp after reboot.[[BR]]
initially it is bound to 192.168.2.1.[[BR]]
It is also not possible to upload openwrt image via web interface. This aborts with an error.[[BR]]
Up to now i would consider SE551 as unsupported as there is no possibility to upload firmware to the device.[[BR]]

= Hardware found in device =

It seems, that flash memory is integrated into CPU. [[BR]]
CPU is covered by a soldered in heat sink, so I can not find out cpu version.

10Pin Connector (JTag ? Serial ?)

||Function||Pin#||Pin#||Function||
||Connected 0V||1||2||NC||
||Connected 3.1V||3||4||NC||
||Connected 3.4V||5||6||NC||
||NC||7||8||NC||
||GND||9||10||+3.4V||
Connected means, I get a signal here with the given voltage or I measured current to GND.[[BR]]
Pin 5 toggles in the last stage of bootup. This might be serial TxD.
