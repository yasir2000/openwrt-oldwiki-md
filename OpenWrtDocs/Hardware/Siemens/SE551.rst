Currently it seems, that boot_wait is turned off, as the device does not respond to tftp after reboot.[[BR]]
initially it is bound to 192.168.2.1.[[BR]]
It is also not possible to upload openwrt image via web interface. This aborts with an error.[[BR]]
Up to now I would consider SE551 as unsupported as there is no possibility to upload firmware to the device.[[BR]]

This router seems however to have a propiertary OS instead.

So AtherosPort seems like the right place

It seems, that flash memory is integrated into CPU. [[BR]]
CPU is an AR2316A Atheros Chipset and covered by a soldered-in heatsink

You need an external level shifter IC like a MAX3232.[[BR]]
/!\ For additional safety I added a 500E resistor in line to pin 5, as I measured some voltage (3.3V), when pin not connected.
