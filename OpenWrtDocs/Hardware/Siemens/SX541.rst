= Siemens Gigaset SX541 =

The device is based on Texas Instrument AR7, so you need the [:AR7Port]
in OpenWrt trunk.

In addition, patches which support the BRN bootloader are needed.

Currently, the kernel starts booting and crashs, so this is definitely
work in progress...

i have comptley done a modell change to the smc version and back to siemens. incl up and downgrade of the bootloader, done by webinterface. only thing, i can't get work is the Marvel bridge, smc one seems to have a 8 port bridge, web-interface shows me them, but not able to access. lan ports of the siemens are working.
