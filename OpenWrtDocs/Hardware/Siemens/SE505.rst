'''Siemens SE505'''

The SE505 is based on the Broadcom 4710 board. It has a 125MHz CPU, 4Mb flash and 16Mb RAM.
The wireless NIC is a mini-PCI card. boot_wait is on by default.


/!\ '''This router sits on 192.168.2.1 during boot_wait, so You have to TFTP to that address.'''

/!\ '''The reset button is hardwired on this unit, so there is no failsafe mode.'''

/!\ '''The IP of the machine uploading firmware has to be 192.168.2.100.''' [documented under FAQ on the Siemens site]

Appearantly, there at least 2 versions of this router. The newer one has more flash and ram, but there were some problems getting OpenWrt to work on it, see the forums.

Also, the new experimental firmware (20050424) doesn't seem to work in the older model, the details are currently beeing worked out.
