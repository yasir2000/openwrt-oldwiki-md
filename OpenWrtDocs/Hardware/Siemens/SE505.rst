There are currently three versions of the SE505. Only the version SE505 v1 and  SE 505 v2 are currently known to be supported by OpenWRT. The third version, SE505 v3, has not yet been reported to work.

/!\ '''boot_wait is on by default on both supported versions.'''

/!\ '''These routers sit via NVRAM on 192.168.2.1 during boot_wait, so You have to TFTP to that address.'''

Another description (in German) and link to images of both versions can be found here: http://wiki.opennet-initiative.de/index.php/Siemens_SE505

= Siemens SE505 v1 =
The inital version (v1) is based on the Broadcom 4710 board. It has a 125MHz CPU, 4MB flash and 16MB RAM. The wireless NIC is a mini-PCI card.

After several bugfixes releases from WHITE RUSSIAN (RC2) works well on this router.

/!\ '''The reset button is hardwired on the Se505 v1, so there is no failsafe mode. You can set back default nvram settings by pressing reset button while turning on the router.'''

/!\ '''The IP of the machine uploading firmware has to be 192.168.x.100.''' [documented under FAQ on the Siemens site]

= Siemens SE505 v2 =
The SE505 (v2) has a 200 MHz BCM4712KPB CPU, 4MB flash and 8 MB RAM on board. This hardware version has been sold in important quantities as part of ADSL packages from major ISPs in Germany and Austria.

SE505V2 is very similar to [:http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Belkin/F5D7230:Belkin F5D7230 v1440] (2MB flash), and you can compile the Broadcom reference firmware or get serial access using the tips in http://midnightcode.org/papers/ . Hacking telnet access to the original Linux-2.4.20 firmware from Siemens, using http://midnightcode.org/projects/pluto/code/belky-0.5.c (see SeattleWireless:Belkin_20F5D7230_2d4 "shell on the box" ).

Problems with the hardware detection in Whiterussian RC5 have been fixed in RC6. The former recommendation to fall back to Whiterussian RC4 is obsolete now.

Whiterussian RC6 "micro" will work, but limited RAM will result in poor stability when using PPPOE.   However, as RAM upgrade to 16MByte or 32MByte, and retrofitting USB makes this cheap box an alternative to more expensive hardware with USB, like ASUS WL500G.

== Internal Connectors ==
On Siemens SE505V2 models, the JTAG connector is labeled J7 (male 2mm connecting plug).

{{{
JTAG connector J7
   2   1
    o o
    o o-TDO
GND-o o-TDI
GND-o o-TCK
GND-o o-TMS

}}}
The serial connector is labeled J2 and has the following pinout (Molex 2mm):

{{{
serial connector J2
       |---|

}}}
Refer to the [:Serial Console:Serial Console ]page for details on the necessary 3.3V / RS232C level shifter.

== SE505V2 Hardware Mods ==
=== RAM Upgrade ===
The SE505V2 can be easily modded to 16 MB RAM, but it requires good soldering skills. The SE505V2 has one 4Mx16 SDRAM chip (8 MB), and spare pads for a second RAM chip. RAM initialization in the CFE seems to be fixed to 4Mx16 (it gnores the sdram_init value in the nvram). 8Mx16 chips will be used as 4Mx16 chips. Mixing 4Mx16 and 8Mx16 is possible.  32MB are reported to work by using two 16Mx16 chips.

Instructions to upgrading from 8MB to 16MB:

1) solder a 4Mx16 SDRAM chip to the unpopulated RAM pads.

2) connect the address lines for the second RAM chip:

{{{
shorten the pads with the following labels using fine wire:
  R314
  R315
  R316
  R317
  R318
}}}
After booting the router you should have 16MB ! :)

Now do:

{{{
nvram set sdram_ncdl=0
nvram commit
reboot
}}}
to let the CFE reconfigure the timing value. This is all you have to do! It makes no sense to change in sdram_init, since it is ignored by the CFE of this router.

Hint: don't solder a capacitor to C319! This capacitor is for fine trimming the RAM timing, and it isn't necessary for stable operation..

TODO: If you solder 32 MB into the router (two 8Mx16 SDRAM), only 16MB will be used (32MB when upgrading with 64MB chips). According to the boot message on the serial interface, the CFE  only sees 16MB. Setting a different value to "sdram_init" doesn't help. If anyone knows how to build the Siemens / Belkin variant of the broadcom CFE, please let us know.

=== Retrofitting USB ===
The SE505V2 can be retrofitted a USB1.1 port. Note that mass storage attached to USB1.1 "full speed" is much faster than SDcards with the MMC mod, and it uses only a fraction of the CPU cycles of simulated SPI interface through GPIO. Writing to a thumb drive formated with the EXT2 is typically 10 times as fast as writing to the JFFS file system ([../../../http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=8656 see forum thread])!

The following USB devices have been tested with this mod : thumb drive, USB HD, RS232 interface (PL2303), USB CTC device, audio class device, USB hub.

Note: for taking full advantage of the USB mod, a RAM upgrade is highly recommended!

Instructions for retrofitting a USB port to the SE505V2:

1) +5V USB power supply .

{{{
On the power plug side you will unpopulated pads. Add the following components:
  C906: capacitor 100µF ( >= 16V )
  C986: capacitor 10µF ( > 16V )
  U981: LM7805 (TO220 w/ pin 2 bended to the back side will work)
}}}
2) USB components :

{{{
On the antenna side of the PCB add the following components:
  F51: shorten(better use a 500mA polyfuse)
  R723 and R724: resistors 15k
  R733 and R734: shorten (better use 22R - 33R)
  J51: USB-plug (Reichelt.de part# "USB AW-VL")
}}}
Software side: Installing USB kernel modules is simple. Note that the SE505V2 has an OHCI controller.

=== Reset Button Mod ===
The reset button is hard wired to the CPU reset generator chip (7703I) by a capacitor. By removing this capacitor entering failsafe mode, as well as running scripts in /etc/hotplug.d/buttons is possible (very useful for unmounting USB mass storage devices!).

Instructions:

1) Hardware side.

{{{
Locate C365 near J7 (JTAG connector) and LED "LAN4".
  C365: remove
}}}
2) Software side

As of Whiterussian RC6 there is no working hardware detection for SE505V2. A simple patch to diag.c will work (contact nbn or timobeil).



= Siemens SE505 v3 =
SE505 v3) has a BCM4712KFB CPU, 2 x 2MB flash (AT45DB161B) and 8 MB SDRAM (M12L64164A-7T). The PCB is prepared for USB and JTAG, but doesn't have a pads for a second RAM chip.

Retrofitting the JTAG and the USB interface is most likely possible. Replacing the RAM chip by a chip with 16MB or  32MB has not yet been reported to work, and it might require a new CFE. It is not known if the flash chips are supported by the current JTAG tools.

Most reports suggest that there is are compatibility problems with OpenWRT in SE 505 v3.
