=== Sitecom WL-105 ===

The Sitecom WL-105 is a 54 Mbit wireless access point. There are two types which are completely different. Both are Linux
based. The older "b" version is based on a Broadcom 4702 chipset. The two units look very different. In the picture you can see
the WL-105b.

=== Opening the WL-105b ===

Underneath the little rubber feet there are four screws that need to be removed to open the unit.

=== The board of the WL-105b ===

On the board there is one mini-PCI card, which is 802.11g. There is room for another mini-PCI card. This device is also sold by other companies,
which market it specifically as a machine that can do both 802.11a and 802.11b or 802.11g. The other mini-PCI slot is used for the 802.11a card.
Searching on the Internet for WX-5520A gives a few results. Apparently both Gemtek and Genuin Korea sell the same device as Sitecom.
