=== Sitecom WL-105 ===

The Sitecom WL-105 is a 54 Mbit wireless access point. There are two types which are completely different. Both are Linux
based. The older "b" version is based on a Broadcom 4702 chipset. The two units look very different. In the picture you can see
the WL-105b.

=== Opening the WL-105b ===

Underneath the little rubber feet there are four screws that need to be removed to open the unit.

=== The board of the WL-105b ===

On the board there is one mini-PCI card, which is 802.11g. There is room for another mini-PCI card. This device is also sold by other companies,
which market it specifically as a machine that can do both 802.11a and 802.11b or 802.11g. The other mini-PCI slot is used for the 802.11a card.
Searching on the Internet for WX-5520A gives a few results. Apparently both Gemtek and Genuin Korea sell the same device as Sitecom.

=== WL-105b firmware ===

The official firmware from the Sitecom website is in trx format.

=== Installing OpenWrt ===

Installing WhiteRussian RC5 will not work on the WL-105b. Even though it will install, it will not work afterwards. When using the squashfs image you should be able to get into failsafe mode (see ["OpenWrtDocs/Troubleshooting"]), but it looks like the reset button in this device is not recognized by OpenWrt.

Reflashing the old firmware using TFTP also does not work, since the bootloader apparently does not accept TFTP packets.


=== Quirks ===

Apparently there is a whole batch of these devices that have a very poor wireless performance due to badly soldered antennas. Sitecom actually has done a recall for this when the device was released to replace the units. You might want to swap the network card and antennas or resolder.
