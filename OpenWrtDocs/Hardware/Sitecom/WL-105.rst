=== Sitecom WL-105 ===

The Sitecom WL-105 is a 54 Mbit wireless access point. There are two types which are completely different. Both are Linux
based. The older "b" version is based on a Broadcom 4702 chipset. The two units look very different. In the picture you can see
the WL-105b.

=== Opening the WL-105b ===

Underneath the little rubber feet there are four screws that need to be removed to be able to open the unit.
