 * Special header with "Magic Number" 0x59a0e842, checksum of following data(kernel and romfs)
 * Next in flashfile is the kernel also with special header and "Magic Byte sequence", checksum of kernel etc
 * Some filling 0x00 bytes follow
 * and after that the SquashFS-LZMA
[Memory map and byte sequences...]

The special header is generated by the binary "packbin" from the source package.
