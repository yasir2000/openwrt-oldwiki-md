This 4 ethernet port, 1 USB and 125Mbps modem/router box apears to have 'ASW802' on the pcb, which means it's a clone, not another device (http://www.dtnettech.com/store/comersus_viewItem.asp?idProduct=1877).
There is a manufacturer name mash up, ["OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Castlenet/ASW800"] appears to be sort of the same device.

It has hardware slightly different from Castlenet ASW800, listed here, are only the chips which are different:

* DSP: TNETD7200 ZDW
* WLAN: TNETTW1350 GVF (advertised as 125Mbps 802.11g+)

with 16MB SDRAM and 4MB flash. Wireless NIC is fit into a mini-pci slot.


The number of features included in the web-config of the original firmware includes QoS and WLAN bridge. It runs MontaVista.

== Serial Port ==

It has two lables RX1 and TX1 just near the usb port.

There're also two unlabled sets of pins, one with four pins in a row, and another one with two, 7 pins in each row.
As the tags are JP102 and JP900, these might be used with jumpers.
