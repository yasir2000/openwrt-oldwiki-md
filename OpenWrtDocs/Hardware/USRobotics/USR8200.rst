The USR8200 is a non-wireless router, advertised as a Firewall/VPN. This single board network processor consists of an Intel速 IXP422 XScale速  processor operating at 266MHz, 64Mbytes of SDRAM, and 16Mbytes of Flash. Peripherals include one 10/100 Base-TX Ethernet "WAN" port with crypto acceleration, and 4 10/100 Base-Tx Ethernet ports on a Marvell switch. The router also has a FireWire port, 2 USB2.0 ports and internally, an RS-232 serial port (full voltage) and a JTAG port.

== Software ==
The installed bootloader is "OpenRG", written by Jungo.
=== RedBoot ===
A custom version of !RedBoot has been built and can be loaded with the instructions on the [http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Actiontec/MI424-WR MI424-WR] page. The custom version for the USR8200 is attachment:redboot.bin. Once !RedBoot is installed as the bootloader, and configured, you can then install the linux kernel and rootfs image from !OpenWrt.

This version detects PHYs on both Ethernet ports, but !RedBoot only uses one, eth0, which maps onto the WAN port of the USR8200.
=== Installing OpenWRT ===
This is a skeleton of the procedure...
 USR8200> load -u tftp://192.168.10.2/redboot.bin -r 0 
 ''Once that finishes, you can type reboot or press reset.'' 
 RedBoot> load -r -b %{FREEMEMLO} -h 192.168.10.2 /openwrt-ixp4xx-zImage 
 RedBoot> fis create linux 
 RedBoot> load -r -b %{FREEMEMLO} -h 192.168.10.2 /openwrt-ixp4xx-squashfs.img 
 RedBoot> fis create rootfs 
 RedBoot> reset 

Plug a pc into LAN port '''4''' otherwise the Marvel 88E6060 switch will not detect any machines connected on the lan side. This is a quirk of the switch at present. There is full support for this switch coming. Should start making appearances in the 2.6.28.x kernels. See [http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=74209#74209 Lennert Buytenh's patch announcement] for details. Open a browser to http://192.168.1.1 and enjoy.

=== Restoring Factory Firmware ===
Restoring factory firmware has been done with this unit.

1. You will need a either one of these types of server already setup - tftp, http, ftp.
For this example, I have setup my tftp server on ip address 192.168.10.2
If you wish to use http instead, add -m HTTP to the command. It must be capitalized. Same goes for FTP.
Generally speaking, it helps to have a few ip addresses on the server machine, it will answer to requests for.
On my server, I plugged in a second network card. Makes accessing the internet and serving files to a temporary subnet easier. This command makes the second card respond on either 192.168.10.x and 192.168.11.x subnets. 
It comes in handy when testing Lan and Wan connections. 

 ip addr add 192.168.10.2/24 dev eth1 
 ip addr add 192.168.11.2/24 dev eth1 

2. You will need to get a special redboot, one that has been built to run from RAM.
That can be downloaded at { to be decided }. It is named redboot-RAM.img to distinguish it from the ROM version.

3. The backup image, here, will be named jungo-image.bin I used 
[http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Actiontec/MI424-WR MI424-WR]  Jose Vasconcellos' jungo-image.py to create my backup. It can do more than make the backup... but at the time, my tftp server was not responding to anything. It does have some literals in it you may need to change to match your network setup.

4. There are 2 steps to restoring the factory firmware. 
 1. First, install the redboot that runs from RAM. 
 1. Once running from ram, it becomes safe to program at any address on the flash chip. 

==== Load redboot-RAM.img ====
load -h 192.168.10.2 /redboot-RAM.img 
 go 
 ''Once it loads you should check for '''RAM''' in the version command.'' 
 version 
 
 ''Make sure this instance also has network access with a ping command.'' 
 ping -h 192.168.10.2 

==== Restore Factory Firmware ====
load -h 192.168.10.2 -r -b %{FREEMEMLO} /jungo-image.bin 
 
fis unlock -f 0x50000000 -l 0x1000000 
 
fis write -b %{FREEMEMLO} -l 0x1000000 -f 0x50000000 

Some output. 
 
* CAUTION * about to program FLASH

== Hardware Hacking ==
Although this router has no wireless support, there is tracking and pads on the circuit board for a mini-PCI card, which may allow a wireless card to be added. Work is in progress to determine if this is feasible.
