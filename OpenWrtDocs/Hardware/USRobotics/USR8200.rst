The USR8200 is a non-wireless router, advertised as a Firewall/VPN. This single board network processor consists of an Intel速 IXP422 XScale速  processor operating at 266MHz, 64Mbytes of SDRAM, and 16Mbytes of Flash. Peripherals include one 10/100 Base-TX Ethernet "WAN" port with crypto acceleration, and 4 10/100 Base-Tx Ethernet ports on a Marvell switch. The router also has a FireWire port, 2 USB2.0 ports and internally, an RS-232 serial port (full voltage) and a JTAG port.
