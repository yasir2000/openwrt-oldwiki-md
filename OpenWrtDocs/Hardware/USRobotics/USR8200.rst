The USR8200 is a non-wireless router, advertised as a Firewall/VPN. This single board network processor consists of an Intel速 IXP422 XScale速  processor operating at 266MHz, 64Mbytes of SDRAM, and 16Mbytes of Flash. Peripherals include one 10/100 Base-TX Ethernet "WAN" port with crypto acceleration, and 4 10/100 Base-Tx Ethernet ports on a Marvell switch. The router also has a FireWire port, 2 USB2.0 ports and internally, an RS-232 serial port (full voltage) and a JTAG port.

=== Features ===

== Software ==
The installed bootloader is "OpenRG", written by Jungo.
=== RedBoot ===
A custom version of !RedBoot has been built and can be loaded with the instructions on the [http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Actiontec/MI424-WR MI424-WR] page. The custom version for the USR8200 is attachment:redboot.bin. Once !RedBoot is installed as the bootloader, and configured, you can then install the linux kernel and rootfs image from !OpenWrt.

This version detects PHYs on both Ethernet ports, but !RedBoot only uses one, eth0, which maps onto the WAN port of the USR8200.
=== Installing OpenWRT ===
TBC
== Hardware Hacking ==
Although this router has no wireless support, there is tracking and pads on the circuit board for a mini-PCI card, which may allow a wireless card to be added. Work is in progress to determine if this is feasible.
