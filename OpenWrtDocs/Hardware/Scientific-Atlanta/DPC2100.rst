The Scientific-Atlanta WebStar '''DPC2100''' is cable modem based on Broadcom BCM3349 chip. Ethernet and USB ports are provided. The modem is compatible with DOCSIS and EuroDOCSIS standards(?).

See ["BroadcomBCM33xxPort"] for general progress on porting to this SoC.

= Software =
By default, the DPC2100 comes with eCos, which is GPL

Luke's DPC2100 had a sticker on the flash chip labelled: SA-DPC2100 V2.0.2R1242

== Source Code ==

eCos is licensed under the GNU GPL. However, Scientific-Atlanta appears to have completely ignored the licensing terms, as there is no sign of the GPL text nor source code with this cable modem. The eCos maintainers and gpl-violations.org has been notified, and hopefully they will be able to extract the eCos source which can be used as a reference for Linux drivers.

= Accessing DPC2100 =

== Opening the Case ==

Two annoying screws (not flatblade or phillips) under the front rubber feet (adhesively attached). Then you need to pull it apart a certain way...

== Serial Header ==

There is a 4-pin TTL-level serial header inside. However, the standard 4-pin CD-ROM cable does NOT fit it. Removing the header itself is a pain, so avoid it if possible.
The default baud rate is 115200.

== Ethernet Access ==

Standard firmware provides configuration interface using HTTP.
