Obviously, the board is prepared to be assembled with a MAX3232 or similar. The pads can either be used to directly connect a 3.3V serial cable or the missing parts (MAX3232, capacitors, resistors; have a look at the datasheet) could be soldered on the board. I chose to connect a cable directly using the pads as described above. Settings are 115200,8,N,1.
