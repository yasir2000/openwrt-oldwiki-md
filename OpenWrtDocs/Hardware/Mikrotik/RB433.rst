=== Hardware ===

RB433 and RB433AH are rather similar boards, except for the microSD slot (RB433AH only), CPU frequency (300 vs. 680 MHz) and RAM size (64 vs. 128 MB).

=== Netboot ===

The bootloader of RB433 is able to load an image in elf format via BOOTP into RAM and execute it.

==== Build the Target ====
You need to get svn trunk. Choose "Target System" == "Atheros AR71xx", "Target Images" == "ramdisk". Build it.
Copy '''bin/openwrt-ar71xx-vmlinux-initramfs.elf''' into the tftpd directory, e.g. into '''/tftpboot/rb433.netboot'''.

==== Setup the Host ====
You need BOOTP and TFTP server on your host machine, e.g. '''dnsmasq''' and '''tftpd-hpa'''.

===== dnsmasq Configuration =====

Changes in /etc/dnsmasq.conf:

 * allow a DHCP range, e.g. {{{ dhcp-range=192.168.6.100,192.168.6.119 }}}
 * allocate an IP address to the board, e.g. {{{ dhcp-host=00:0c:42:XX:XX:XX,192.168.6.101 }}} (replace the XX with the MAC address of your board!)
 * set filename (produced above) and tftpd server for BOOTP, e.g. {{{ dhcp-boot=/tftpboot/rb433.netboot,boothost,192.168.6.1 }}}

===== Start tftpd server =====
May be already done by (x)inetd, for '''tftpd-hpa''' I had to execute:
{{{ in.tftpd -l }}}

==== Setup the Target ====

 * Connect to the serial port with a null modem cable (115200, 8N1).
 * Press a key shortly after powering the board.
 * Press '''o''' to change the boot device 
 * Press '''e''' to boot from ethernet in the future.
 * Press '''x''' to leave setup (<key>-o-e-x is needed only once, the boot method is saved in non-volatile memory)

If everything is setup correctly it should look like:
{{{
RouterBOOT booter 2.16

RouterBoard 433AH

CPU frequency: 680 MHz
  Memory size: 128 MB

Press any key within 2 seconds to enter setup..

...
}}}

=== Permanent Installation ===
You need a working '''netboot''' first, see above.

==== Erase the NAND Flash ====
If you want to install OpenWRT permanently into the NAND flash you once need to erase the NAND flash
to get rid of the RouterOS stuff:

 * connect via serial line
 * press a key shortly after powering the RB433 up
 * press '''e''' and type '''yes''' to format the flash from the bootloader

==== Setup the Host ====
An http server is required on the host, e.g. micro-httpd.
To set it up I added the line
{{{
www	stream	tcp	nowait root	/usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/sbin/micro-httpd /tftpboot
}}}
into '''/etc/inetd.conf'''

==== Build the Target ====
You need to get svn trunk. Choose "Target System" == "Atheros AR71xx", "Target Images" == "tgz". Build it.
Copy '''bin/openwrt-ar71xx-vmlinux.elf''' and '''openwrt-ar71xx-rootfs.tgz''' into the httpd root directory , 
e.g. into '''/tftpboot/''' (see setup of ''micro-httpd'' above).

==== Install OpenWRT into Flash ====
 * Start '''netboot''' (see above).
 * Press ENTER to get a shell prompt.
 * Execute:
{{{
wget2nand http://<host ip address>
}}}
e.g.
{{{
wget2nand http://192.168.6.1
}}}
This script will set an IP address via dhcp on br-lan.
The output should look like:
{{{

...
Image written, you can now reboot.  Remember to change the boot source to Boot from Nand 
}}}
 * Power-cycle the RB433 and change the boot source to NAND.
=== Switch setup ===

==== Ethernet Jacks ====
The ethernet jacks are mapped to port numbers of the IP175C switch (looking at the front of the board):
{{{
[ port 4 (PoE)] ( serial ) [port 1] [port 2]
}}}
Currently (svn trunk r13124) eth0 is mapped onto port4, while eth1 uses port1 and port2. Port1 and Port2 are not switched in the default config.
If you want this behaviour, you need kmod-switch with phorn's patches and
{{{
uci set network.0.vlan1="1 2 5*u"
/etc/init.d/network restart
}}}
