=== Hardware ===

RB433 and RB433AH are rather similar boards, except for the microSD slot (RB433AH only), CPU frequency (300 vs. 680 MHz) and RAM size (64 vs. 128 MB).

=== Netboot ===

The bootloader of RB433 is able to load an image in elf format via BOOTP into RAM and execute it.

==== Build the Target ====
You need to get svn trunk. Choose "Target System" == "Atheros AR71xx", "Target Images" == "ramdisk". Build it.
Copy '''bin/openwrt-ar71xx-vmlinux-initramfs.elf''' into the tftpd directory, e.g. into '''/tftpboot/rb433.netboot'''.

==== Setup the Host ====
You need BOOTP and TFTP server on your host machine, e.g. '''dnsmasq''' and '''tftpd-hpa'''.

===== dnsmasq Configuration =====

Changes in /etc/dnsmasq.conf:

 * allow a DHCP range, e.g. {{{ dhcp-range=192.168.6.100,192.168.6.119 }}}
 * allocate an IP address to the board, e.g. {{{ dhcp-host=00:0c:42:XX:XX:XX,192.168.6.101 }}} (replace the XX with the MAC address of your board!)
 * set filename (produced above) and tftpd server for BOOTP, e.g. {{{ dhcp-boot=/tftpboot/rb433.netboot,boothost,192.168.6.1 }}}

===== Start tftpd server =====
May be already done by (x)inetd, for '''tftpd-hpa''' I had to execute:
{{{ in.tftpd -l }}}

==== Setup the Target ====

 * Connect to the serial port with a null modem cable (115200, 8N1).
 * Press a key shortly after powering the board.
 * Press '''o''' to change the boot device 
 * Press '''e''' to boot from ethernet in the future.
 * Press '''x''' to leave setup (o-e-x is needed only once, the boot method is saved in non-volatile memory)

If everything is setup correctly it should look like:
{{{
RouterBOOT booter 2.16

RouterBoard 433AH

CPU frequency: 680 MHz
  Memory size: 128 MB

Press any key within 2 seconds to enter setup..
