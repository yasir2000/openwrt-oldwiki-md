=== Hardware ===
The RB532 is a router with three Fast Ethernet ports, one supporting PoE, two MiniPci slots and a Compact Flash slot. The board comes with a MIPS32 4Kc based 400MHz embedded processor. For further information use this [http://www.routerboard.com/pdf/rb500r5ugP.pdf link].

=== Initial Installation ===
The following instructions are thought for use with CF cards! With the release of Kamikaze it is now possible to use OpenWrt on the RB532 without having to compile your own images.

==== Installing image onto CompactFlash Card ====
Download links to Kamikaze are provided on [http://www.openwrt.org the main page].  Several images are available for the rb532 with varying filesystem block-sizes. 128k is the default block-size of CF Cards, the openwrt-rb532-2.6-jffs2-128k.bin image is suggested.

{{{
 # dd if=openwrt-rb532-2.6-jffs2-128k.bin of=/dev/<cardreader>
}}}
and put the card to the board

==== Bootloader Configuration ====
Put the CF to the board. Use the serial terminal of your choice with 38400 8N1. If you use screen the line is:
{{{
RouterBOOT booter 2.8

RouterBoard 532A

CPU frequency: 399 MHz
  Memory size:  64 MB

Press any key within 2 seconds to enter setup

RouterBOOT-2.8
What do you want to configure?
   d - boot delay
   k - boot key
   s - serial console
   o - boot device
   u - cpu mode
   f - try cpu frequency
   c - keep cpu frequency
   r - reset configuration
   e - format nand
   g - upgrade firmware
   i - board info
   p - boot protocol
   t - do memory testing
   x - exit setup
your choice: e - format nand


Do you realy want to format your nand?
that would result in losing all your data
type "yes" to confirm: yes
formating nand... done!
}}}
{{{
 # screen /dev/<serial> 38400 8N1
}}}
Power it. The default boot delay is short, so the first time using a board you will have to be fast to interrupt the boot process by pressing enter.  This is what you see then:

{{{
 RouterBOOT-1.5
 What do you want to configure?
    d - boot delay
    k - boot key
    s - serial console
    o - boot device
    u - cpu mode
    f - try cpu frequency
    c - keep cpu frequency
    r - reset configuration
    g - upgrade firmware
    i - board info
    p - boot protocol
    t - do memory testing
    x - exit setup
 your choice:
}}}
Set the delay to about 5 seconds

{{{
  your choice: d
Select boot delay:
 * 1 - 1s
   2 - 2s
   3 - 3s
   4 - 4s
   5 - 5s
   6 - 6s
   7 - 7s
   8 - 8s
   9 - 9s
your choice: 5
}}}
then set the boot device by choosing 'o' then 'c'.

{{{
your choice: c - boot from CF
RouterBOOT-1.5
What do you want to configure?
   d - boot delay
   k - boot key
   s - serial console
   o - boot device
   u - cpu mode
   f - try cpu frequency
   c - keep cpu frequency
   r - reset configuration
   g - upgrade firmware
   i - board info
   p - boot protocol
   t - do memory testing
   x - exit setup
your choice:
}}}
then press 'x' to continue booting.

If it boots correctly you can continue with configuring !OpenWrt.

==== Flashing the NAND ====
First we have to start with a clean NAND. We need to format the NAND. You can say goodbye to the RouterOS. Open source is better.
