'''Linksys WRT54GS'''

=== Hardware versions ===
There are three versions of the WRT54GS. Both are based on the 4712 board. They have a 200MHz CPU, 8Mb Flash and 32Mb RAM. You can get the version number from the sticker on the bottom of the device. If you are unsure about the version number, just give it a try, the file upload will automatically be cancelled if your device is not supported.

==== WRT54GS v1.0 ====
The WRT54GS v1.0 uses an ADM6996 switch and SDRAM. These units are fully supported by OpenWrt.
The device can be identified by ModelName WRT54GS or WRT54GS-XX, where XX should be a 
country toplevel domain code (EU, DE, ...).

==== WRT54GS v1.1 ====
The WRT54GS v1.1 uses a BCM5325 switch and DDR-SDRAM. These units are supported in the EXPERIMENTAL branch of OpenWrt.

==== WRT54GS v2.0 ====
We have no information about the internals of these units, yet. As noone saw a v2.0, yet we can't be sure, but it should work with the EXPERIMENTAL branch of OpenWrt.
