The console is located on the same edge that the LEDs are, that is, front-right side of the board.
It is labeled J1 and an arrow points to pin 1 on the left, that is, the closest pin to the LEDs.
Voltage reference is 3.3 volts and it is set by default at 38400,8,N,1.
Mine already had a connector soldered just like to ones we usually see on computer boards as CPU/NB fan connector.
