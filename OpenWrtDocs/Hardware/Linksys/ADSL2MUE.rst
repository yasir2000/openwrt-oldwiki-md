== Opening the ADSL2MUE ==

To reach the serial console you have to first unscrew the unit. Underneath the little rubber feet under the blue part of the unit there are two tiny
screws. Gently remove the little rubber feet and you can open the unit.

The console is located on the same edge that the LEDs are, that is, front-right side of the board.
It is labeled J1 and an arrow points to pin 1 on the left, that is, the closest pin to the LEDs.
Voltage reference is 3.3 volts and it is set by default at 38400,8,N,1.
Mine already had a connector soldered just like to ones we usually see on computer boards as CPU/NB fan connector.

The serial port is marked with the red circle on the picture (lower left corner).
