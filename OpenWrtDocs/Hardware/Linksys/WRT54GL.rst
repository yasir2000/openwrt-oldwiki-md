= Linksys WRT54GL =
The WRT54GL is basically a v4.0 [:OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Linksys/WRT54G: WRT54G] that still runs Linux.
The only known version of this model has serial numbers starting with `CL7A`. There is a German version (and Polish, so it may be the EU version) of the WRT54GL, v1.1, that has serial numbers starting with `CL7B`.  See the [http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=15672 WRT54GL] thread in the forum.
The model number shown on the package, the front panel, and the sticker on the underside of the unit is WRT54GL.  The FCC ID sticker says it is [https://gullfoss2.fcc.gov/prod/oet/cf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&RequestTimeout=500&calledFromFrame=N&application_id=615033&fcc_id='Q87-WT54GV40' WT54GV40], so it is substantially identical to a WRT54G v4.0/WRT54GS v3.0.  The WRT54GL has 16MB of RAM and 8MB of flash memory.
