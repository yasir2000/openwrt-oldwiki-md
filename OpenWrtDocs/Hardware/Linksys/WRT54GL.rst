= Linksys WRT54GL =
The WRT54GL is basically a v4.0 [:OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Linksys/WRT54G:WRTG54G] that still runs Linux. The 1.0 version of this model has serial numbers starting with {{{CL7A}}}; version 1.1 models have serial numbers starting with {{{CL7B}}} and {{{CL7C}}}.  As of August 2006, version 1.1 appears to be shipping worldwide.  See the [http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=15672 WRT54GL] thread in the forum. The model number shown on the package, the front panel, and the sticker on the underside of the unit is WRT54GL.  The FCC ID sticker says it is [https://gullfoss2.fcc.gov/prod/oet/cf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&RequestTimeout=500&calledFromFrame=N&application_id=615033&fcc_id='Q87-WT54GV40' WT54GV40], so it is substantially identical to a WRT54G v4.0/WRT54GS v3.0.  The WRT54GL has 16MB of RAM and 4MB of flash memory.

Note that the wireless part is only supported on the 2.4-kernel version of Kamikaze. The 2.6-kernel runs fine on the box, but (because the wl.o driver from Broadcom is only available for 2.4 kernels) the wireless driver does not work.

=== System Info ===
The WRT54GL v1.1 uses a Broadcom 5352 CPU with integrated switch. The board is practically identical to the board used for the [:OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Linksys/WRT54G:WRTG54G] v4.0 and [:OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Linksys/WRT54GS:WRTG54GS] 4.0 (4Mb version)

Latest version uses Samsung Flash. The GL v1.1 (bottom label reads v1.1, e.g. Firmware 4.30.2 or .5) runs  RC6, Freifunk 1.4.5c and webIF (X-WRT) images no problem at all. Good availability at 55-60 EURO in August 2007.

=== Switch Ports (for vlans) ===
Numbers 0-3 are Ports 1-4 as labeled on the unit, number 4 is Internet on the unit, 5 is the internal connection to the router itself. Don't be fooled: Port 1 on the unit is number 3 when configuring vlans.

== v1.2 ==
I have seen revision v1.2 in the shop. The sales guy told me it would not run homebrew linux. So i ended up buying a [:OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Linksys/WRT54GS:WRTG54GS] which i now sucks and works. :) Has anyone seen a v1.2 revision to work?

I bought a WRT54GL today and received a v1.1 so I would expect that this is still the latest version. OTOH LinkSys claimed that the GL version is specifically targeted at hackers that customize their WRT, so why would they sell one that can not be customized? Did anybody else already see a v1.2 at all?  -- TorstenLandschoff

I tell you. I had the Package in my Hand. I backed of buying i because, as i sayed, had no confimation it will work.
It was at Arlt in Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany. Possibly only a -DE Version?


I bought a new WRT54GL in Germany at amazon.de (in May 07) The Revision is v1.1. The router was manufactored in 01/2007.
I can see this date on a sticker on the bottom of the router. -- ThomasBrinkmann

The WRT54GL is Linksys' response to angry customers.  For a long time, they had the original WRT54G, which was hackable, but when they joined with Cisco they made it so you were unable to hack the router.  Thus, the 54GL.  Version 1.1 is the current release, and as of yet there is no v1.2.  --CharlesEddy
