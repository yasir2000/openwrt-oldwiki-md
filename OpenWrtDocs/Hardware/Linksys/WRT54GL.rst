= Linksys WRT54GL =
The WRT54GL is basically a v4.0 ["OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Linksys/WRT54G"] that still runs Linux. The 1.0 version of this model has serial numbers starting with {{{CL7A}}}; version 1.1 models have serial numbers starting with {{{CL7B}}}.  As of August 2006, version 1.1 appears to be shipping worldwide.  See the [http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=15672 WRT54GL] thread in the forum. The model number shown on the package, the front panel, and the sticker on the underside of the unit is WRT54GL.  The FCC ID sticker says it is [https://gullfoss2.fcc.gov/prod/oet/cf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&RequestTimeout=500&calledFromFrame=N&application_id=615033&fcc_id='Q87-WT54GV40' WT54GV40], so it is substantially identical to a WRT54G v4.0/WRT54GS v3.0.  The WRT54GL has 16MB of RAM and 4MB of flash memory.

== v1.2 ==
I have seen revision v1.2 in the shop. The sales guy told me it would not run homebrew linux. So i ended up buying a [:OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Linksys/WRT54GS:WRTG54GS] which i now sucks and works. :)
Has anyone seen a v1.2 revision to work?
