The linksys WRV54G is no Wrt, it does not use a broadcom chip, and runs on arm instead of mips.

For now, i recommend the openixp project if you have a wrv.

 The Linksys WRT54GS was a really good choice, but there are some problems with it, mainly that the speed of the processor not enough for driving the radio/ethernet at full speed and unfortunatelly the radio and the ethernet driver not in GPL, so no any modification possibility,etc.
The high-end AP's now contains Intel ARM processors,  Linksys have a VPN router that also have a GPL code, relatively cheap, so no any problem, let's modify it........
The hardware mods was relatively simple task. Using an SVHS 4 pole connector and a mobile phone serial cable, there is a serial console. Soldering some pins to the JTAG connector and building the EA232-compatible parallel cable also isn't hard. But the unit has an empty miniPCI slot which we must use - desoldering from a damaged Dlink AP and soldering to the PCB don't easy but possible. The case has an empty RPSMA connector place - an UFL-RPSMA pigtail solve the connection between the second Atheros a/b/g miniPCI card and the outside.The mainboard has full support for this slot, there are even an unsoldered (but working) LED on the front panel to showing card activity. The picture of the unit (click to enlarge):
  WRV54G
First of all, the GPL code are uncomplete and unuseable, there was no any piece of code that we can use. It use an old 2.4 kernel and initrd like most of the commercial AP device. There are some good information at seattlewireless about the hardware,the bootloader,etc. Two monts ago Barnabas Kalman and I started the "OpenWRV" project to yield an open-source , powerfull router/AP device based on the Intel IXP425 processor. Because the lack of the useable implementations, we choose the latest 2.6.13 kernel version and the buildroot2 environment. The unit based on the IXP425 processor - the first step register and download the  Intel Access Software Library from Intel. It is necessary because the processor has the two Network Processing Engine ( co-processors making the Ethernet ports) bult-in. Patching the kernel with the Intel code was a hard work, but this was just the beginning of the nightmare...
After the first (semi)successfull compilation we have a kernel image, but how can we use it? First of all it is necessary to build the serial interface to reach the bootloader console. The original bootloader can load images from the tftp server and start it automatically ( it seems that the bootloader have just one eth port, the internet - address 192.168.2.1). Disassembling the original code shows that the kernel image loaded and executed with the small piece of code before and after the kernel code, so we do the same. After downloading - happened nothing, no serial console. Searching for the problem ( we are at the assembly code now ) and voila: the printascii doesn't work because it has hard coded address for the serial0 and we must use the serial1. From now we can debugging, but the normal console doesn't work. Tracking the code until the kernel real start show that the code is working.Patching printk to use the assembly code output routine help to mimic the console and find the real error: changing the serial port parameters (baudrate,etc) kill the serial port. But because this is just a console instead of find the error, we just skip the port setting and everything is working - at least the kernel started.
The next step was to produce a jffs2 filesystem. Patching into he buildroot environment, we have a uClibc based linux root image. Placing it to the flash we choose that the first Mbyte occupyed by the kernel, after that there is a jffs2 image. Ok, but the bootloader make a checksum of the image in the second partition  and if changed  - because of the jffs2 write - invalidate it. Therefore first must load the kernel to the partition 2 and after that load the jfffs2 image to the same partion but with direct write to 0x240000. In this case the bootloader seems just the kernel on the partition. If you -like I am - issue a wrong number in the line  "load -u tftp://192.168.2.10/xxx.img.jffs2 -r 0x240000" there is no warning, the bootloader overwrited, the unit doesn't boot. Keep in mind that you must build the JTAG connector and first make a complete flash backup - it took hours....
Now the system starting, find the root filesystem, mounting it. The ethernet port1 (ixp1) after finding the right settings (mainly from the coyote board) and the right microcode image the internet ethernet port working. The original Prism54 card supported by the 2.6.13 kernel except the microcode - after find it we doesn't use the complicated hotpug firmware method,instead simly pass the microcode to the kernel driver. In the second minipci slot we use an Atheros 5213 a/b/g card. Because the new features the driverset downloaded from the new madwifi-ng, after some patching it is also working. The only thing remain was the first ethernet port (ixp0). This is connected to the Kendin 8995M switch controller - but with an SPI bus, so using the GPIO lines must implement the protocoll. In the implemented SPI driver the bus is reacheable over the /proc for userspace programs. After programmining the switch controller the LAN ports on the switch are reacheable, but the goal was an independent usage of the ports - therefore we must use the switch VLAN functionality. One side is OK, with vconfig is possible to create on the ixp0 interface as many VLANs as we need, but no the switch documentation nor the application notes content not working as expected - the switch can assign VLANS to the ports and working accordingly, but in this case on port 5, the port connected to the micropocessor there are no any traffic?.... The solution is to set the "special tag" mode on - in this case the switch in the VLAN header insert the port number also ( 0x810p instead of 0x8100). That way the ixp0 receive the packets but with "wrong" VLAN header, so as a quick and dirty solution in OSAL we simply masked out this byte... Making a /proc/sys/diag interface to driving the LED's after that was an easy task.
Now we have the latest 2.6.13 kernel based linux on a writeable jffs2 filesystem on a powerful machine. The netperf result for the ixp1  94 Mbps on a switched ethernet network, ixp0 (with vlan) 86.5 Mbps , the atheros card (no turbo, gmode)  24.5-25 Mbps and the average processor load in this case 15-20%!
To do:
- replace the bootloader with RedBoot
- setting kernel and jffs2 unpadded at the same image
- serialize the image - hardcoded ethernet MAC addresses
- identify and solve the serial port issues
- use the built-in hardware for the crypto devices
- decide to publish or not the code - there are several reason to be careful, the Intel code cannot be GPL'ed , patch into maybe illegal,etc.....
