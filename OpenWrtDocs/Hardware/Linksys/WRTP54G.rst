The Linksys WRTP54G and Linksys RTP300 linux-powered units are Voice-over-IP enabled routers based on the TI AR7 chipsets.

||'''WRTP54G'''||'''RTP300'''||
||1 Ethernet uplink port, 4x 10/100MBps switch ports, 2 phone jacks, and 54MBps 802.11b/g support||virtually indentical unit lacking the wifi support and antenna.||
||||Both units appear to be based on CyberTAN's WGV614 and BRV614 respectively... ||

The WRTP54G and RTP300 both run dropbear SSH and some time ago root access was gained to an RTP300 box.
 
The nearly complete contents of that router's file system were extracted and stored [http://www.northern.ca/projects/openwrt/RTP300-1.0.55-fs-dump.zip here]

All of the entries in the ''/proc'' directory were cat-ed out to a log file found [http://www.northern.ca/projects/openwrt/rtp300-1.0.55-proc-dump.txt here]

An number of the common montavista router linux tools are found (cm_logic, webcm, etc)... the following page describles some very interesting hacking techniques that likely also apply to the WRTP54G / RTP300: http://sub.st/index.php?page=hacking_actiontec
