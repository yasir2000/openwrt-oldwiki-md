== Firmware Dumps for Study ==
 * The nearly complete contents of a RTP300 router's mounted file system (version 1.00.55) were dumped, zipped and uploaded to [http://www.northern.ca/projects/openwrt/RTP300-1.0.55-fs-dump.zip here]
 * The nearly complete contents of a WRTP54G router's mounted file system present on firmware version 1.00.60 has been dumped, zipped and uploaded to [http://www.m-a-g.net/wrt-11.1.0-r021-1.00.60-r060123.tar.bz2 here]
 * All of the entries in a RTP300's ''/proc'' directory were cat-ed out to a log file found [http://www.northern.ca/projects/openwrt/rtp300-1.0.55-proc-dump.txt here]
 * A dump of all the flash blocks from an RTP300 with firmware 1.0.55 is available [http://www.northern.ca/projects/openwrt/RTP300-1.0.55-fs-dump.zip here]! This is different the mounted file system dumps which contain only the files from the mounted root
 * The root file system extracted from firmware version 3.1.17 is available here attachment:wrtp54g-3.1.17-root.tar.bz2
== Misc Notes ==
 * CyberTAN is a subcontractor for Linksys and their name appears in the router's source code (even the source code archive's name: _cyt_).
 * The VoIP daemon appears to be "RADVISION SIP TOOLKIT 3.0.5.1" (/usr/sbin/ggsip)
 * The telephony chip is the Legerity Le88221, part of the VE880 series. There is a website with product liturature and example code at http://www.legerity.com/products.php?cid=&sid=1&bpid=33
 * A channel on Freenode #wrtp54g is where those devoted to hacking the wrtp54g and rtp300 hang out.

= Source Code Supplied by Linksys =
 * The source code supplied by Linksys is incomplete, it's missing the source for some of the utilities (cm_*, lib_cm, webcm) which are used in changing config settings and flashing new firmware updates.
 * There appear to be pieces missing which make the code as a whole unbuildable. At any rate, though several people in various forums have asked how to build the source code, nobody has posted instructions.
 * The source code supplied for some similiar Linksys routers, such as the WAG354GV2, has a more complete build system.
 * You can rebuild parts of the source code using the Montavista AR7 cross-compiler toolchain.
 * If rebuild parts of the source code using the OpenWrt AR7 cross-compiler toolchain, you will get unusable binaries which the system mistakes for shell scripts.
= Related Sites =
 * A number of the common [http://www.mvista.com/ MontaVista] linux router tools are found (cm_logic, webcm, etc) on these devices... the following page describles some very interesting hacking techniques that likely also apply to the WRTP54G / RTP300: [http://sub.st/articles/hacking-the-actiontec-gt701/ http://sub.st/articles/hacking-the-actiontec-gt701/ ]

 * Some of the information on this page is derived from Linksysinfo.org: http://www.linksysinfo.org/portal/forums/archive/index.php/t-37891.html
= The Supplied Firmwares =
All of the known firmwares have the following characteristics in common:

 * Linux 2.4.17 kernel with Montavista patches
 * uClibc
 * Busybox
== Characteristics of Firmware Version 1.00.XX ==
As of September 2006, Vonage loads firmware version 1.00.62. This firmware has the following distinguishing characteristics:

 * Busybox is built without the more command
 * Rotary phones work
 * The voice status page displays very little information, basically just whether the last registration suceeded or not
 * Voice configuration is badly broken
  * The "Voice" tab is a dud which suggests that one contact one's service provider for "more information"
  * There are no links to the voice pages
  * The voice tabs do not include the higher level tab bar, so there is no easy way to move out of "Voice"
 * Distinctive can be used by setting ALERT_INFO to <Bellcore-dr''X''> where X is 1--7.
 * Some people have reported that the lines will not stay registered with an Asterisk server, especially if both are registered. This is discussed below.
 * There are no visible settings for an outgoing SIP proxy or an STUN server. There is a setting which may be for sending NOTIFY messages to keep a NAT mapping active, but it does not seem to work.
 * The default register interval is 1 minute. This is rather short and may be intended to keep the NAT mapping active.
If your phone lines will not register with the SIP server or will not stay registered, check these things:

 * Make sure there are no DNS servers entered in the provisioning tab (may be labeled "Vonage DNS Servers")
 * Use server names, not IP addresses.
 * If you can, log in using SSH or the serial console and make sure /etc/resolv.conf lists only good DNS servers.
== Characteristics of Firmware Version 3.1.XX ==
In July and August 2006 Linksys released firmware 3.1.17 for the WRTP54G-NA and RTP300-NA respectively. Previous versions in the 3.1.XX series, such as 3.1.10 which is floating around the Internet have problems registering with some SIP server or connecting to PPPOE servers.

Firmware 3.1.17 has the following distinguishing characteristics:

 * Busybox is built with the more command
 * Rotary phones do not work
 * The voice static page displays a wealth of information about registration as well as current and previous calls
 * NOTE: The voice pages are essentially that of Sipura's, replete with documentation (ETSI, dialplans, etc.)
 * The voice tab works and the voice pages display the top level tab bar
 * Distinctive ring works
 * There are visible settings for NAT traversal features including NAT keepalive, an outgoing SIP proxy, and an STUN server.
 * The default SIP register interval is one hour.
 * Dropbear binary removed and ssh setting disabled.
== Characteristics of Firmware Version 3.1.22 ==
 * Ping hack works (enter '''0.0.0.0 &&'''''''command'''' as address to ping)
== Characteristics of Firmware Version 3.1.24-NA ==
After some experiments with a few WRTP54G-ER units bought in April 2007, further information was gathered about the newer firmware, now at 3.1.24-NA (haven't seen an ETSI version yet).  Note that these units were fortunately shipped with the console (serial port) unlocked.  So much progress was made without having to resort to JTAG.

 * The SIP processing (ggsip) is dramatically different from the 1.0.xx versions.  Here's a brief rundown:
 * The SIP parameters are no longer stored in the main configuration, but kept in a formerly unused flash block at 0xb07c0000 - 0xb07effff (mtd9).
 * The new ggsip program handles '''all''' voice related configuration.  Almost all voice-related web pages are generated within ggsip.  Some voice pages still linger in the file system, but they are unused.
 * ggsip isn't easily fooled into giving up its secrets.  This is why the usual unlock methods such as cyt and banging on the ESC key while loading some pages are unable to gain you access.  You '''must''' have entered a valid Admin password before it lets see or alter Provision and Line settings.
 * ggsip rewrites /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow (sym-linked into /var/tmp) with its own password when it starts up.  That means if you've set an Admin password (capital 'A') in your normal xml configuration file, you have about 30 seconds before ggsip starts up and changes the password to what it has stored in its config area.  This means that even if your firmware has "No Admin password" you need to be quick with your login or you'll still be locked out.
 * There are settings within this new config area that can prevent the ping & traceroute tools from working, thereby preventing exploits using those tools.
 * If you have somehow gained access, but not the voice pages, you can erase or format the flash block mentioned above which will wipe the voice configurations (including the Admin password) and gain full access.  No password will be required, and you can change it once you're in.  Note that this also changes the Admin password used to log in from ssh (dropbear).
== Characteristics of Firmware Version 5.02.04 ==
In late summer of 2007, Vonage began upgrading RTP300's to firmware version 5.02.04.  This firmware is currently being studied.  Details will be posted shortly.

 * Ping hack works (enter '''0.0.0.0 &&''command''''' as address to ping)
= Customized Firmwares =
 * 3.1.17 firmware with dropbear and ssh enabled attachment:wrtp54g_fw_3.1.17_US.zip  (NOTE: This firmware has a sticky SSH remote administration setting, available to WAN, with Admin enabled and no password. Blocking port 22 doesn't seem to help.)
= Accounts in the Official Firmwares =
In the default configuration, the RTP and WRTP54G have three usernames, one with each of the defined access levels.

== admin ==
This user has an access level of "ROUTER". This appears to be the level of access required to log into the top page of the router and to change settings related to the router functions. The default password is "admin".

== user ==
This user has an access level of "USER". Oddly, this access level permits flashing the firmware whereas level "ROUTER" does not. Accounts with access level "USER" cannot be used to log into the router independently. One must first log in as a user with "ROUTER" level access and then present  the username and password of an account with "USER" level access when the prompt "Enter username and password supplied by your service provider" appears.

== Admin ==
This is the only user represented in /etc/passwd which means that this is the only user that can be used to log in using SSH and on the serial console (the latter when /etc/inittab specifies that /bin/login is to be run on the console rather than /bin/sh). This user has the access level "ADMIN" which also permits flashing the firmware but does not allow independent login.

= Web Access =
The primary way to configure these devices is through a web interface. In the initial configuration the LAN IP address is 192.168.15.1. There is a web server with a management interface running on port 80. The default username is "admin" with a password of "admin". If you find that the web server is not running or the password "admin" is not accepted, you can reset the router to factory defaults by using a paper clip to hold down the reset button while powering the router up. Continue to hold down the reset button for about 50 seconds.

= SSH Access =
Version 1.00.XX firmwares for both the WRTP54G and RTP300 both can run the Dropbear SSH server. This feature must be enable using the web interface. The only username in /etc/passwd is "Admin" (note the upper case A). Reliably setting the password for this account is problematic.

== Noteworthy Programs and Files in the 3.1.XX Firmware ==
 * /etc/inittab
  . Starts /etc/init.d/rcS and starts /bin/login or /bin/sh on the serial console.
 * /etc/init.d/rcS
  . System startup script. Not much to see since most of the work is done by the mysterious "lightbox".
 * /usr/bin/foxy
  . an HTTP proxy server which implements the "filter JavaScript" and other "security" functions
 * /usr/bin/wget
  . GNU Wget (why not Busybox wget?). This is appearently used to download new firmwares.
 * /usr/bin/lightbox
  . Mystery program run from /etc/init.d/rcS. It seems that it must start most of the daemons
 * /usr/bin/cm_convert
  . Converts old voice configuration to the 3.1.XX format. Run once per boot.
 * /usr/bin/cm_logic
  . Seems to load the configuration ether from a specified flash block or from an XML file.
 * /usr/bin/cm_config
  . Saves and restores the current configuration to flash.
  . Usage: cm_config {BACKUP|RESTORE} {ADMIN|USER|ROUTER}
 * /usr/lib/updatedd
  . dynamic DNS client
 * /usr/www/cgi-bin/webcm
  . Program through which most web pages are loaded.  Implements a sort of server-side-includes.  Accepts POST requests to change the configuration.
 * /usr/www/cgi-bin/firmwarecfg
  . Target of POST request which uploads a new firmware
 * /var.tar
  . This file is unpacked during boot.  It creates the /var directory
 * /var/upgrader (from var.tar)
  . Appearently the program which does the actual firmware flashing
 * /sbin/reboot
  . Restart the router

Notes:

 * The 8MB flash contains two firmware areas. This is presumably so that the system can boot from a backup firmware firmware flashing fails. mtd3 and mtd4 contain the two firmwares. Which firmware is active seems to be determined by the setting of the boot loader environment variable BOOTCFG.
 * Unused space at the end of memory blocks is filled with the value 0xFF.
 * mtd0 ''root'' is mounted as /. It is a 1.x squashfs image with LZMA compression instead of Zlib. A new squash file system can be built using the mksquashfs from the src/squashfs directory of the source tarball. This mksquashfs has been patched to use LZMA compression instead of Zlib.
 * mtd5 and mtd6 contain a 20 byte header beginning with a "LMMC" (hex 4C 4D 4D 43 00 03 00 00), followed by a Zlib compressed copy of the XML configuration file. There is one configuration partition for each firmware. The format of the compressed configuration file is described elsewhere in this document.
 * mtd7 ''RESERVED_BOOTLOADER'' contains a ["PSPBoot"] bootloader code and environment variables. The environment variables can be read from ''/proc/ticfg/env'' after boot. Some of them can be set by writing to /proc/ticfg/env.
 * These partitions are accessible after boot as /dev/mtdblock/0-9 (block device mode, suitable for mounting) or /dev/mtd/0-9 (character mode, suitable for reading or writing with dd). A partition must be erase before it can be written to. Flashing firmware is fully described elsewhere in this document.
 * The directory /dev/ti_partitions/ contains symbolic links to serveral of the flash partitions. The intent seems to be to give them meaningful names.
= Firmware Update File Format =
Here is a partial description of the format of the firmware update file format which is accepted by the web interface and the slightly different format which can be written into flash from the boot loader console (accessible through the serial interface).

 * Bytes 0x00 thru 0x03 are "CDTM". This is presumably a magic number identifying the file as a firmware.
 * Byte 0x0B must be 0xFF for the web interface and 0x17 if written directly into flash. The web interface changes this byte to 0x17 before writing the firmware into flash.
 * Bytes 0x14 thru 0x17 must match the value of ProductID from the boot loader environment or the web interface will refuse to load the firmware and if you write it into flash from the boot loader console, the boot loader will refuse to boot it.
 * Bytes 0x70 thru 0xAF contain the file name of the firmware, presumably so that it can be identified even if renamed.
 * Bytes 0xb0 thru ?? appear to be a partion table defining partions "kernel" and "root"
 * From the end of the partition table to 0xFFFF is filled with the value 0xFF.
 * Bytes 0x010000 thru 0x08FFFF are the kernel. Unused space at the end is filled with the value 0xFF.
 * Bytes 0x90000 thru 0x3AFFFF are the squashfs root filesystem. The first four bytes of the squashfs are "hsqs".
 * Firmware images intended to be written directly into flash end at this point.
 * Bytes 0x003b0000 thru 0x003b0003 are a little-endian magic number of 0xC453DE23.
 * Bytes 0x003b0004 thru 0x003b0007 are a little-endian CRC of all bytes from the start until just before the magic number.
If the file is to be written directly into flash it must be 3,866,624 (0x03B0000) bytes long. A firmware uploaded through the web interface will be eight bytes longer.

== Working with Firmware Files ==

Here are programs which you can use for packing and unpacking firmware image files:

 * Firmware modification Kit attachment:wrtp-mod-kit.tar.bz2
 * David Chappell's scripts:
 ** Perl script to set CRC: attachment:set_ti_checksum
 ** Perl script to set ProductID and flag at byte 0x0B: attachment:set_ProductID

'''''extractwrtp''' extracts the firmware into the following files: ''
 * '''''wrtp.img.root''''' root file system partition (lzma compressed, use unsquashfs-lzma to extract)
 * '''''wrtp.img.kernel Kernel''''' parition (bootstrap + kernel)
 * '''''wrtp.img.7zip''''' compressed kernel.
 * '''''wrtp.img.uncompressed''''' uncompressed kernel.
 * '''''wrtp.img.kernel.bootstrap''''' bootstrap code that extract compressed kernel
 * '''''wrtp.img.kernel.padding''''' padding part of kernel partition.
 
'''buildwrtp''' builds the firmware by combining kernel partition and root partition
   -k <kernel file>
   -r <root file>
   -f <output file>
   -i <device identity>
   -p <product id>
   -K <minimum hex blocks (64K) for kernel patition>
   -R <minimum hex blocks (64K) for root partition>

== Working with the Squashfs ==
Standard Linux kernels cannot mount the squashfs file system and the standard mksquashfs can not generate it because the compression method is LZMA instead of Zlib.  To pack and unpack these squash file systems, you can use the patched copy of Squashfs Tools 1.3r3 linked to below:

   * Patched Squashfs Tools 1.3r3: attachment:squashfs-tools.tar.bz2

   * The patch: attachment:lzma427_zlib.patch

'''unsquashfs-lzma''' can be used to extract the files from a root partition image (previously extracted from a firmware image file) into a directory

'''mksquashfs-lzma''' packs the contexts of a directory into a root partition image which can subsequently be packed into a firmware image file

The configuration of the router is stored in a single XML file. This file is stored compressed in a raw flash partition. If when the router boots the flash partition is found to be empty, the configuration is initialized by loading /etc/config.xml from the root partition.

The configuration can be extracted using the web interface (Administration/Management/Backup and Restore). The configuration file produced by the backup function is incomplete. Particularly, it omits the voice configuration.  The backup configuration file format is as follows:

 * Bytes 0x0000 thru 0x0003 contain "LMMC". This is appearently a magic number
 * Bytes 0x0004 thru 0x0005 are 0x00 and 0x03 respectively. This may be a continuation of the magic number.
 * Bytes 0x0006 thru 0x0007 should be set to zero
 * Bytes 0x0008 thru 0x000B contain the length of the compressed configuration file in little-endian format
 * Bytes 0x000C thru 0x000F contain a CRC of the compressed configuration file
 * Bytes 0x0010 thru 0x0013 contain the length of the uncompressed configuration file
 * Bytes from 0x0014 on contain the configuration file in Zlib's deflate format
= Boot Loader Environment =
The PSPBOOT boot loader contains a set of environment variables, some of which are used by the boot loader itself, while others are used by the firmware after boot.

At the serial console the printenv command displays the whole environment while the setenv, unsetenv, and setpermenv commands modify it. Note that the setpermenv command will write the environment setting into the flash boot area (pspboot)!  This will make the environment setting read only.  The only way known to undo this process is to re-flash the boot loader.  This can be done by making a dump of the flash block, editing out the "perm" environment variables, and then re-flashing.  It's been done from within a running system at the shell prompt.

After boot, the boot environment can be read and written through the pseudo-file /proc/ticfg/env. Reading the file returns the environment, one variable per line, with a tab between name and value. Writing a line in the same format changes a variable, as long as it is not read-only. A space may be substituted for a tab when writing.

Here is a sample boot environment from an RTP300 as read from /proc/ticfg/env. HWA_0, HWA_1, and !SerialNumber have been anonymized.

== CONSOLE_STATE ==
Setting this variable to "locked" causes PSPBoot to load the firmware without giving the user an oportunity to go to the PSPBoot prompt by pressing escape. Setting it to "unlocked" restores friendly behavior. See the Serial Console section for a way to unlock the console.

== IPA, IPA_GATEWAY, SUBNET_MASK ==
These variables define the IP settings used by the tftp command. It makes sense to change IPA to "192.168.15.1" since this is the IP address which the standard firmwares assign to the router.

== ProductID ==
This is a four character code which identifies the hardware. Bytes 0x14-0x17 of the firmware file must match this code or you will not be able to install it using the web interface. If you write it to flash by some other means, PSPboot will refuse to load it.

Known ProductID values:

 * RTP300-NA: CYLM
 * RTP300 from Vonage: CYLL
 * WRTP54G-NA: CYWM
 * WRTP54G from Vonage: CYWL
One can trick a device into loading a firmware which was not intended for it by changing the ProductID in the firmware and updating the CRC at the end of it. (Refer to the description of the firmware update file format above.) Loading an incompatible firmware may brick your device, so be careful. In particular, loading an WRTP54G firmware on an RTP300 will brick it, but only when you do a factory reset. The reason for this is that /etc/config.xml in the WRTP54G firmware is incompatible with the RTP300. It seems that a system daemon crashes when it attempts to configure the wireless hardware. As long as the configuration created by the RTP300 firmware remains in place, all is well, but a factory reset copies config.xml into the configuration area. If you do this, you will have to use a serial console to regain access.

== IMAGE_A, CONFIG_A, IMAGE_B, CONFIG_B ==
The router has room for two firmwares and a configuration area for each. Factory defaults can be restored by formatting the configuration area of the currently active firmware. (There are other ways to do this including a screen in the web interface and holding down the reset button for a few seconds once the device has booted.) The command to clear the conifguration area of the first firmware is:

{{{fmt CONFIG_A}}}

Possible ways to write a new firmware to IMAGE_A or IMAGE_B are described elsewhere in this document.

== BOOTCFG_A, BOOTCFG_B, BOOTCFG ==
The firmware to be booted is defined by BOOTCFG. The significance of the m and the f are unknown. The variables BOOTCFG_A and BOOTCFG_B are appearently models for setting BOOTCFG.

One investigator has reported that there not seem to be a direct and reliable way to set BOOTCFG. But, if there are two firmwares installed and one formats the image partition of the one named in BOOTCFG, BOOTCFG will automatically switch to the other one.  However, he may have used setpermenv from the PSPBoot prompt, which would reportedly makes environment variables unchangable.

Do not connect the router's serial port directly to your computer's RS232 port. The signal voltage levels are not the same and you may damage the router's serial port. This is because your computer's serial port has a line driver which converts the computer's signal voltage levels to RS232 levels while the line driver was left out of the router to save money. So, you will have to attach a line driver to your router and plug your computer into the line driver. If you are handy with a soldering iron you can order a AD233AK 233A kit and assemble it to make a line driver.

The default settings for the serial port are 115200 BPS, 8 bit words, no parity, hardware flow control. These settings may be changable by setting the boot environment variable MODETTY.

The serial port is the boot loader console. If the boot-loader environment variable CONSOLE_STATE is set to "unlocked" (rather than "locked") then you will have three seconds to stop the boot (by pressing ESC) and receive a boot loader prompt.  If you manage to get shell, you could try the following to unlock the PSPBoot console with this command:

{{{
# echo "CONSOLE_STATE unlocked" >/proc/ticfg/env}}}

You should try to do this as soon as you can since you may need to use the serial console to recover after flashing a bad firmware.  If it is not unlocked, your ownly remaining option is to use a JTAG cable to read the environment block, use a hex editor to change "locked" to "unlocked" (followed by a 0 byte) and write the environment block back to flash.

Most if not all firmwares allow login on the serial port once they are booted. Some run /bin/login whereas others simply run /bin/sh. The 3.1.10 firmware which is floating around the internet, though said to be unstable, does have the advantage that it accepts "Admin" as a username with a blank password. Once you have logged into a running firmware you can change CONSOLE_STATE with the command:

= JTAG =
JTAG is a standard way to gain access to the system bus of an embedded device. It can be used to reprogram the flash even if the boot loader has been damaged.  The AR7 implements ejtag version 2.6.

This ejtag layout should apply to all ar7 based boards with a 14 pin jtag pinout. The same cable as used for the wrt54g (based on the xilinx III/dlc-5) as described by !HairyDairyMaid can be used with the RTP300. Debug INT pin 13 is optional.  A 100 Ohm resister should be connected between pins 1 and 14.

The JTAG utility written by HairyDairyMaid for the WRT54G can be used to reprogram the flash.  Version 4.8 has been confirmed to work correctly with the RTP300 if the correct options are used.

= Firmware Flashing =
There are several proven ways to write a new firmware into flash:

 * Using the web interface
 * Using firmware update on the provisioning page
 * Using command line tools under a running firmware
 * From the PSPBoot prompt using the serial port console

It is presumably possible to write a firmware using JTAG, but it would be very slow, at least using a passive cable connected to a parallel port.

The PSPBoot page suggests that there is a one second window during PSPBoot startup during which a TFTP server is ready to accept a new firmware named upgrade_code.bin, but this feature does not seem to be included in the build of PSPBoot installed on the RTP300.

== Using the Web Interface ==
This method ranges from very easy to somewhat tricky depending on what firmware is currently installed. The basic procedure is as follows:

 1. Connect a computer to one of the yellow ports of the router
 1. Set the computer to gets its IP address by DHCP and make sure it does so before proceeding
 1. Connect to http://192.168.15.1 using a web browser. If it does not respond, hold down the router's reset button for at least five seconds. When it reboots, try again.
 1. Log in using the default username and password of "admin" and "admin"
 1. Click on the "Administration" tab
 1. Click on the "Firmware Update" tab. If there is no "Firmware Update" tab, enter http://192.168.15.1/update.html in your browser's location bar.
 1. Log in as a user who is permitted to update the firmware. For generic and Earthlink firmwares, the username may be "Admin" with a blank or "sP0dfub2" password or "user" with a password of "user". If your router was last used with Vonage, you can set a username of "user" and a password of "tivonpw" by following this procedure:
  a. Plug the router into the Internet if it is not plugged in already.
  a. Got to Administration tab and choose Factory Defaults. Choose "Restore Router Defaults" and "Restore Voice Defaults"
  a. Enter a username of "user" and a password of "tivonpw"
  a. Give the router a minute to reboot and then return to step three.
 1. Click on Browse and choose a firmware image. (If you get an error page instead of the firmware upgrade page, enter http://192.168.15.1/update.html into your browser's location bar. Some firmwares have a broken link.)
 1. If the Internet cable is connected to the router, disconnect it.
 1. Click on Update. A progress bar will move accross the screen. When the bar reaches about 10% the product ID will be checked. After it reaches 100%, the CRC will be checked. If both of these hurdles are passed, a screen will appear announcing that the device is rebooting.
 1. If your router was last used with Vonage, log in again and go to Administration->Factory Defaults and reset both router and voice defaults again. The router has two configuration areas, and the old settings may not be cleared out of active configuration area. If they are not, the router may download and install a firmware that you do not want.
 1. Reconnect the router to the Internet.
If the web server does not respond in step three, or the default password does not work in step four, make sure the router has been powered up for at least 50 seconds and then hold down the reset button for at least five seconds. The router will restore its factory defaults and reboot. Return to step three.

If your router is running an NA firmware, the username needed in step seven is probably "Admin" (note the capital A verses the lower case a in step four). The password will be blank.

If your router is running Earthlink (ER) firmware 3.1.14, the username needed in step seven is "Admin" (note the capital A verses the lower case a in step four). The password will be "sP0dfub2" (case-sensitive).

If your router has Vonage firmware on it, the procedure is slightly more complicated. First, you should plug your router into the Internet so that it can load its configuration from Vonage's servers. This will give you a user name of "user" and a password of "tivonpw" which you can use in step seven. Second, there will be no "Firmware Update" tab in step six. Instead, enter http://192.168.15.1/update.html. (Note: this procedure is incomplete and not entirely correct. One must at some point also go to Administration/Factory Defaults and reset the router and voice configuration to factory defaults.)

If you get a page-not-found error after logging in in step seven, do not dispair. This is bug in some firmwares. Simply enter the address http://192.168.15.1/update.html into your browser and continue from there.

== Using Firmware Update on the Provisioning Page ==
VOIP providers can configure these routers to periodically download a VOIP configuration file. This file contains VOIP settings and login credentials for the provider's SIP server. This process is called "provisioning". The "provisioning" file can also instruct the router to download and install a new firmware. The Provisioning page in the web interface can also be used to initiate this process. This may be helpful if you loose access the firmware upgrade page but still have access to the Provisioning page. Here is the procedure for the 3.1.XX series firmware:

 * Connect to the web interface and log in as admin
 * Click on the Voice tab
 * Click on "Admin Login" hyperlink under the second menu bar
 * Click on the "switch to advanced view"
 * Click on the "Provisioning" tab
 * Enter the URL of the firmware file (HTTP is fine) in the "upgrade rule" field.
 * Press "Save"
 * Watch your HTTP server logs to see if the router grabs the firmware
The firmware should be in the same format as for upgrading through the web interface.

== Using command line tools ==
Using this procedure, you can write a firmware into one of the two firmware partitions. Note that while you can overwrite the running firmware and reboot, it may not be a safe practice. One can presumably overwrite the inactive firmware, but it is unclear how to then make it the active firmware. This procedure describes how to overwrite the inactive firmware.

 * You will need the flash erase tool (erase.c in the GPL tarball) compiled to run on the router. ( attachment:flash_erase )
 * Create a new firmware image. See Firmware Upgrade File Format above. (Briefly, byte 0x000B should be 0x17, there should be no CRC, and the firmware should be exactly 3,866,624 bytes long.)
 * Download <b>erase</b> and the firmware to the router:
{{{
# cd /var
# wget http://myhost/dir/flash_erase
# chmod 755 erase
# wget http://myhost/dir/rtp300-XXXXX.bin
}}}
 * Erase and write the flash block for the first firmware copy:
{{{
# /var/flash_erase /dev/mtd/3 0 60 && dd if=/var/rtp300-XXXXX.bin of=/dev/mtd/3
}}}
Use /dev/mtd/4 in order to erase and write the second firmware block.

== From the PSPBoot prompt ==
In order to use this method you must obtain or make a voltage converter for your router's serial port and hook it up as described in the section Serial Port. You must also change the value of CONSOLE_STATE as described in the same section. Since you need shell access to the router in order to change CONSOLE_STATE, you will not be able to use this method unless the existing firmware allows shell access.

The PSPBoot boot loader has predefined environment variables called IMAGE_A and IMAGE_B which contain the start and stop addresses of the mtd3 and mtd4 flash partitions. A new firmware can be loaded into one of the spaces by formatting the space and copying in a properly formated firmware file using TFTP. For example, if you have a firmware called new_firmware.bin on a TFTP server on a computer attached to one of the yellow ports with an IP address of 192.168.15.100, the commands are like this:

{{{
setenv IPA 192.168.15.1
fmt IMAGE_A
tftp -i 192.168.15.100 new_firmware.bin IMAGE_A
}}}
If your TFTP server is not in the same subnet or the subnet mask is not 255.255.255.0 you will have to set additional environment variables as described under Boot Loader Environment.

== Locked Out ==

There are several circumstances where you can be locked out of your router.

=== Unlocking Tools ===

You can try CYT Device Unlock tools written to unlock the device to allow it to be used with other than vonage; it gets the "Firmware Upgrade" tab to show as well as the sip settings info.  This tool resets the password for the Admin account and the user account.  It also shows the current passwords for these accounts.  I found by Googleing for it.  This is the current URL location for the tool :   Warning a reset sets everything back to factory.
