The Linksys WRTP54G and Linksys RTP300 linux-powered units are Voice-over-IP enabled routers based on the TI AR7 chipsets.

WRTP54G - 1 Ethernet uplink port, 4x 10/100MBps switch ports, 2 phone jacks, and 54MBps 802.11b/g support
RTP300 - virtually indentical unit lacking the wifi support and antenna

Both units appear to be based on CyberTAN's WGV614 and BRV614 respectively...

CyberTAN is a subcontractor for Linksys and their name appears in the router's source code (even the archive name: _cyt_).

Source Code for the first firmware is available at:
WRTP54G: http://www1.linksys.com/support/opensourcecode/WRTP54G/1.00.37/wrtp54g_cyt_1_00_37_gpl.tgz
RTP300: ftp://ftp.linksys.com/opensourcecode/rtp300/1.00.37/rtp300_cyt_1_00_37_gpl.tgz

The WRTP54G and RTP300 both run dropbear SSH and some time ago root access was gained to an RTP300 system. 
The nearly complete contents of that router's file system were extracted and stored here: http://www.northern.ca/projects/openwrt/RTP300-1.0.55-fs-dump.zip
All of the entries in the /proc directory were catted out to a log file found here: http://www.northern.ca/projects/openwrt/rtp300-1.0.55-proc-dump.txt
