'''WARNING''' This page is a work in progress.  So far I (IanJackson) am just collecting information found in various other places (eg, IRC logs) together.

Bootloader: ["PSPBoot"]
Firmware image: *-WA31.bin for annex a (ADSL over POTS) devices

Known problems:

* `Crashes occasionally' for some people or with some devices.  Currently not known whether this is a hardware problem.

* Using the tftp procedure to upload an openwrt image seems to disable the tftp facility in PSPBoot, so that future upgrades have to be done from within openwrt.
