'''WARNING''' This page is a work in progress.  So far I (IanJackson) am just collecting information found in various other places (eg, IRC logs) together.

Bootloader: ["PSPBoot"] Firmware image: *-WA31.bin for annex a (ADSL over POTS) devices

Known problems:

* `Crashes occasionally' for some people or with some devices.  Currently not known whether this is a hardware problem.

* Using the tftp procedure to upload an openwrt image seems for some people to disable the tftp facility in PSPBoot, so that future upgrades have to be done from within openwrt.  However this didn't happen to me -IanJackson.
