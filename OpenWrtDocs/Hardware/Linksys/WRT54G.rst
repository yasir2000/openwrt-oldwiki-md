'''Linksys WRT54G'''

=== Hardware version ===

There are currently 4 versions of the WRT54G (v1.0, v1.1, v2.0, v2.2). Except the last one (v2.2), the WRT54G
units are supported by the current CVS version of OpenWrt). boot_wait is off by default on theese routers, so You should turn it on.

==== WRT54G v1.0 ====
The WRT54G v1.0 is based on the Broadcom 4710 board. It has a 125MHz CPU, 4Mb flash and 16Mb SDRAM.
The wireless NIC is a mini-PCI card. The switch is an ADM6996.

==== WRT54G v1.1 ====
The WRT54G v1.1 is based on the Broadcom 4710 board. It has a 125MHz CPU, 4Mb flash and 16Mb SDRAM.
The wireless NIC is soldered to the board. The switch is an ADM6996.

==== WRT54G v2.0 ====
The WRT54G v2.0 is based on the Broadcom 4712 board. It has a 200MHz CPU, 4Mb flash and 16Mb SDRAM.
The wireless NIC is integrated to the board. The switch is an ADM6996.


==== WRT54G v2.2 ====
The WRT54G v2.2 is based on the Broadcom 4712 board. It has a 200MHz CPU, 4Mb flash and 16Mb DDR-SDRAM.
The wireless NIC is integrated to the board. The switch is a BCM5325.

/!\ '''The current version OpenWrt doesn't support theese units, yet.'''



=== Hardware hacking ===
There are revision XH units of the WRT54G v2.0. These units have 32Mb of memory, but they are locked to 16Mb. You can unlock the remaining memory with changing some of the variables. Afterburner (aka. Speedbooster) mode can be enabled with some variables, too.

/!\ '''However, there are no guaranties, that these will work, and changing the memory configuration on a non-XH unit will give You a brick. Check the forums for more info.'''
