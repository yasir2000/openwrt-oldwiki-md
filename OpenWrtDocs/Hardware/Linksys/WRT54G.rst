'''Linksys WRT54G'''

=== Hardware versions ===

There are currently five versions of the WRT54G (v1.0, v1.1, v2.0, v2.2, v3.0). Except the last two (v2.2 and v3.0), the WRT54G units are supported by the current CVS version of OpenWrt). boot_wait is off by default on these routers, so You should turn it on.

==== WRT54G v1.0 ====
The WRT54G v1.0 is based on the Broadcom 4710 board. It has a 125MHz CPU, 4Mb flash and 16Mb SDRAM.
The wireless NIC is a mini-PCI card. The switch is an ADM6996.

==== WRT54G v1.1 ====
The WRT54G v1.1 is based on the Broadcom 4710 board. It has a 125MHz CPU, 4Mb flash and 16Mb SDRAM.
The wireless NIC is soldered to the board. The switch is an ADM6996.

==== WRT54G v2.0 ====
The WRT54G v2.0 is based on the Broadcom 4712 board. It has a 200MHz CPU, 4Mb flash and 16Mb SDRAM.
The wireless NIC is integrated to the board. The switch is an ADM6996.


==== WRT54G v2.2 ====
The WRT54G v2.2 is based on the Broadcom 4712 board. It has a 200MHz CPU, 4Mb flash and 16Mb DDR-SDRAM.
The wireless NIC is integrated to the board. The switch is a BCM5325.

/!\ '''The current version OpenWrt doesn't support these units, yet.'''

==== WRT54G v3.0 ====
We have no information about the internals of these units, yet.

=== Hardware hacking ===
There are revision XH units of the WRT54G v2.0. These units have 32Mb of memory, but they are locked to 16Mb. You can unlock the remaining memory by changing some of the variables.
Afterburner (aka. Speedbooster) mode can be enabled with some variables, too.

/!\ '''However, there is no guarantee that this will work. Changing the memory configuration on a non-XH unit will brick your router. Check the forums [url]http://openwrt.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4507 for more info.'''
