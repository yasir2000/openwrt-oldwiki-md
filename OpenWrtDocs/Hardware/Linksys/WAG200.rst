= Linksys WAG200G =
The Linksys WAG200G, and its EU variant (WAG200G-EU), is an ADSL 2+ home gateway which integrates a 4 port switch and an 802.11G wireless  acccess point.

== Specifications ==
 * ADSL 1/2/2+ support (up to 24Mbps)
 * 4 10/100 Ethernet port switch
 * IEEE 802.11b/g compliant

== Hardware ==
The router is based on the Texas Instruments AR7 platform (AR7WRD) which features an integrated MIPS(TM)-based 32-bit RISC core, a digital signal processor-based trans- ceiver and an ADSL Analog Front-End (AFE).
