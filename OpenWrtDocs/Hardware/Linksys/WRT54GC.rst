=== Physical Disassembly ===
Having spent about seven hours trying to take the thing out of its case, here's what I found out:

 * There's a screw! On the back side with the rubber feet, towards the bottom of the bottom-left foot (next to the FCC and "Power: 3.3V 2A" sticker) is a small Philips-head screw.
 * The rest of the case is held by plastic tabs. They come apart with some force, but be gentle: the plastic feels weak.
 * Once the back cover is off, you're almost there. There's two screws that hold the PCB on, also Philips-head. The sticker on the side holds down the ethernet ports, so it must (sadly) be removed. Also, don't forget to disconnect the external antenna connector by removing the nut, and then the antenna selector switch by just pulling it out of the board.
 * Smile and be happy.

More stuff about the router:

 * The chip that's unrecognizable in the FCC photos is an MX B051011. The next three lines read: 29LVB00BTTC-70, 2l375900, and TAIWAN. Google doesn't know the B051011 so i'm kinda lost. Anyone?
 * The power LED actually has two LEDs in one package: an orange and a green.
 * There doesn't appear to be JTAG, but there is a solderpad area. I'll test it for serial, but for now is classified as "unknown".
 * I'll add pictures soon, too.

I really like this device: it's small and uses only 3.3v. I'd really love to get OpenWrt on it, possibly for a future version of my [http://yasha.okshtein.net/wrt54g Wifi Car]. Any takers? The router is quite cheap at $39 (i got it for $29 on Black Friday), but at that price, most users would opt for other, fully supported, routers.
