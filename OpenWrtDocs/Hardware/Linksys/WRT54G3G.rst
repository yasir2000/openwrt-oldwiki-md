This device seems to be a normal [:OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Linksys/WRT54G: WRT54G] with a !CardBus.
It's used by Vodafone for their 3G

There's different 3G data cards bundled with this device. "Vodafone Mobile Connect 3G/GPRS data card" has NEC USB2 controller with two generic USB serial ports builtin. 3G side is connected to those serial ports.

Serial port requires level converter. I used Nokia DLR-3P cell phone datacable. Color coding will NOT match if you use different cable.
