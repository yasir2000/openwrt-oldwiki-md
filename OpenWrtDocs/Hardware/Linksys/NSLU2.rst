= Linksys NSLU2 =
The Linksys NSLU2 (a.k.a. SLUG) is a network storage link based on the IPX42x processor clocked  at 266Mhz.  It contains 8MB flash, 32MB RAM, one ethernet i/f, two USB2.0 ports, and is provided  with a 2.0A 5V power supply.

= Why Run OpenWRT? =
The SLUG has an active user community with several popular firmware distros (e.g. Debian Slug)  so why bother to port OpenWRT?  Well, most likely you agree with OpenWRT's minimalist philosophy  and would rather spend your time adding the features you want rather than deleting those you don't. However, that doesn't mean that you should ignore the vast amount of experience gathered and documented by the SLUG developers...

Note that the NSLU2-Linux project (http://www.nslu2-linux.org) fully supports the porting of OpenWRT to the NSLU2, and intends to "bless" OpenWRT as the firmware of choice for people who want to run all their applications from the internal flash memory only (i.e. with no external storage at all).
