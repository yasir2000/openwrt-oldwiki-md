'''Motorola WR850G'''

== Hardware version ==

The WR850G has three different versions (v1, v2, v3).

=== WR850G v1 ===
The WR850G v1 is based on the Broadcom 4710 board. It has a 125MHz CPU, 4Mb flash and 16Mb SDRAM. The wireless NIC is a mini-PCI card.

=== WR850G v2 ===
The WR850G v2 is based on the Broadcom 4712 board. It has a 200MHz CPU, 4Mb flash and 32Mb SDRAM (but only 16Mb enabled). The wireless NIC is integrated to the board.

=== WR850G v3 ===
The WR850G v3 is based on the Broadcom 4712 board. It has a 200MHz CPU, 4Mb flash and 16Mb SDRAM. The wireless NIC is integrated to the board.


== To put OpenWRT on a Motorola WR850G: ==

 * Open the WR850G.  The plastic is hard and the clips are strong - use force!
 * Attach a serial cable to the serial connector - it's a 9-pin connector with two rows, one with 5 pins and one with 4 pins.  I recommend using a cell phone data cable - they're cheap and do the voltage conversions with no assembly required. 
  * Pin 1 (square hole): Data out of WR850G
  * Pin 7 (three pins over from pin 1): Data into WR850G
  * Pin 6 (two pins down, one across from pin 1): Ground
  * Port setting is 115200, N, 8, 1, no flow control.

 * Restart the router with your serial console hooked up and ready.
 * Hold Control-C in your terminal while it boots.  You don't need boot_wait to be on for this (but it might take a couple tries!)
 * You should get a CFE prompt.  Type flash -noheader : flash1.trx
 * Begin a TFTP transfer of the OpenWRT firmware to the router.
 * When this completes, it will reboot into OpenWRT.
 * Enjoy!

(cleaned formatting; does this actually ''require'' a serial connection? - mbm)

(as far as I know, it is required - unless we can calculate Motorola's CRC to make a "valid" firmware image. - nate)
