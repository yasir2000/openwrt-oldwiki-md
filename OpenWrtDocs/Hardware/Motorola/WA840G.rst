I suspect the WA840G is just the same hardware as WE800G, but radio is in AP mode.

To get the OpenWRT going on that box follow the [:OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Motorola/WE800G: WE800G] instructions.

Just use openwrt-wa840g-<type>.bin firmware images.

== Making images ==
It's necessary to modify the image builder to make a usable image for the WA840G.

Modify motorola-bin.c in {OpenWRT path}/target/utils/src/ by changing line 95 to "firmware->flags = ntohl(0x10577040);"(find the 5 in the number and change it to a 4).

Then go back to the OpenWRT path and run make after configuring the packages.

Thanks to Brittany Benzaia for figuring this out!
