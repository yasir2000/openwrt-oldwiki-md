The Motorola '''SBG900E''' is cable modem based on Broadcom BCM3348 chip. The core chip has no wireless capabilities but MiniPCI card is used to provide b/g WLAN. Ethernet and USB ports are provided. The modem is compatible with DOCSIS and EuroDOCSIS standards. 

The '''E''' stands perhaps for '''Europe''' but that just a guess.

= Hardware =

 * Main Chip: [http://web.archive.org/web/20030627094926/www.broadcom.com/pbs/3348-PB02-403-RDS.pdf Broadcom QAMLinkÂ® BCM3348KPB]
 * Ram: 32 MB SDRAM ([http://web.archive.org/web/20051112090141/www.winbond.com/e-winbondhtm/partner/PDFresult.asp?Pname=1050 Winbond W982516CH-75, 4M x 4 banks x 16bit]) 
 * Flash: Intel (under a over-soldered metal cage)
 * B/G WLAN MiniPCI card (on back-side, under a soldered metal cage) with internal and external (non-removable) antennas

== Connectors ==

On back-side, in top-down order:

 * Reset button
 * RJ45
 * USB v1.1
 * Cable
 * 12 VDC

In addition, there seems to be RJ11 reservation and a place for a chip that is pin compatible with MAX232 chip.

== Leds ==

In front panel. Green, unless otherwise stated. In top-down order:

 * Power
 * Receive
 * Send
 * Online
 * PC/Activity
 * Wireless (Orange led)

= Accessing SBG900E =

== Opening the Case ==

Just one torx in the upper corner of the back (near the antenna). Two clips in the bottom under an adhesive label. In addition, the labeling of the LEDS is adhesively attached. You may either cut the adhesives or remove them (I used the latter alternative). 

== Ethernet Access ==

Standard firmware provides configuration interface using HTTP. Currently, there exists no known way to break into the device/OS through it.

nmap locates these UDP ports:

|| PORT   || STATE         || SERVICE ||
|| 53/udp || open|filtered || domain ||
|| 68/udp || open|filtered || dhcpc ||
|| 161/udp || open|filtered || snmp ||
|| 1030/udp || open|filtered || iad1 ||

The access to snmp port is mostly rejected but there is some info floating around about bitfile method that would enable factory mode which is claimed to be able to run shell cmds (so far no great success with this model if the info is indeed valid). However, modem responds to this command (by tftping for vxWorks.st from 192.168.100.10):

 `snmpset -v2c -c public 192.168.100.1 1.3.6.1.4.1.1166.1.19.3.1.18.0 i <HFC_Magic>`

where ''HFC_Magic'' is a signed 32-bit integer calculated from the HFC MAC's four rightmost bytes (in the human-readable representation). Beware that trying any other IP addresses that the modem is using such as 192.168.0.1 will not do the trick and the snmp is rejected without response.

...Perhaps this TFTP access can eventually be used to load openwrt directly on the router without any soldering.

== Serial Access ==

Provides serial connector J9, which is clearly marked:

||<:25%> 3.3v ||<:25%> GND ||<:25%> SIN ||<:25%> SOUT ||
||<:> O ||<:> O ||<:> O ||<:> O ||

Serial is not yet tested.

== JTAG Access ==

Provides a JTAG connector in J3, which seems to follow similar semantics as [:OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Thomson/TCM390:TCM390] (only 10 pins like it). The mainboard connects resistors to pins 1,3,7,9 and 2,4,6,8,10 to GND as expected. Pin 5 wiring is unique and goes under metal cage under which the MiniPCI card resides. The cage is soldered in place.

JTAG is not yet tested.

== Unknown Stuff ==

 * 1x6 connector J2 very close to the main chip. Purpose unknown...
 * Can the RJ11 + MAX232 pin-compatible chip reservation be used for some purpose...
