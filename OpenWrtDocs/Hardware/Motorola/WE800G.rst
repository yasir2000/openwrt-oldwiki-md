[[TableOfContents]]
= Hardware versions =
The WE800G has three different versions - v1 and v2.

== WE800G v1 ==
The WE800G v1 is based on the Broadcom 4710 board. It has a 125MHz CPU, 4Mb flash and 16Mb SDRAM. The wireless NIC is a mini-PCI card. The mini-PCI card is BCM94306MP and if you happen to brick the box itself then at least it is reusable in your laptop.

== WE800G v2 ==
It is supposed to have the integrated wireless NIC, less memory and less flash, but I haven't seen one to comment.

I think I have the version 2.   I cannot see any different outside and inside.  It also has the same mini-PCI card; however, It only has 2Mb flash and 8Mb SDRAM. It is not that useful even using the micro version of OpenWRT. [goodnewscd added on 2006-04-10]

= Obtaining Official Motorola Firmware =
Motorola does not have any official firmware releases available on their website and will not provide you one even if you ask for it.

 * [http://broadband.motorola.com/consumers/products/we800g/ WE800G product page]
 * [http://broadband.motorola.com/consumers/support/default.asp?SupportSection=HomeNetworking Motorola's Support Site]
 * [http://broadband.motorola.com/consumers/support/gpl_codes.asp Source Code] [http://broadband.motorola.com/consumers/support/GPL/WE800G_V4.04_GPL.tgz partial source of 4.04]

= Flashing to OpenWRT =
Imre Kaloz added WE800G and WA800G support to pre-RC5 and this has found it's way into the RC5 as well.

 * http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/rc5/

Note: The WE800G v1 has plenty of flash and memory and it is capable of accepting firmware of the "bin" directory. Check the [:OpenWrtDocs/Installing: intstalling] page for firmware image differences.

The web upgrade likely does not work (even if to rename the .bin to .trx), but TFTP [OpenWrtViaTftp] will upload it just fine.

 * Set your computer into the same IP subnet (WE800G default IP address is 192.168.30.1 and netmask is 255.255.255.0);
 * Enable boot_wait on WE800G with web browser in /frame_debug.asp page by entering "nvram set boot_wait=on; nvram commit; nvram get boot_wait" into the command slot and press ENTER or click APPLY button;

Note: If you see "on" then the boot_wait was set successfully. If not the repeat the procedure.

 * Start pinging the WE800G on one command prompt window (under Windows: "ping 192.168.30.1 -t");
 * Type the TFTP upload command to the next command prompt window (under Windows: "tftp -i 192.168.30.1 put openwrt-we800g-jffs2.bin" or "tftp -i 192.168.30.1 put openwrt-we800g-squashfs.bin");
 * Unplug/replug the WE800G power;
 * As soon as you see the ping response from the WE800G, hit ENTER for the TFTP upload command;
 * If the upload went fine then you'll see "Transfer successful" message;
 * If you get "timed out" message then repeat the process;
 * After successful flashing wait for some minutes to let the OpenWRT to finish it's upgrade procedures;

Note: After upgrade the IP address of WE800G is set to 192.168.1.1/24 and the box should start answering to pings on that address.

 * Unplug/replug the power of the WE800G or you get wierd permission or other type of errors when you try to change the configuration of this WE800G;
 * Telnet into the box to verify that the OpenWRT is up and running and then unplug/replug the power of the box again;
 * Now you can telnet into it again to set the system password (passwd command) or use your browser to do it;

Note: After you set the password you'll not be able to telnet into the WE800G again, you have to use ssh or browser.

= Upgrade from previous versions of OpenWRT =
Web based upgrade from pre-RC5 to RC5 failed for me with this message:

{{{
Firmware Upgrade

Bad trx header
If this is a firmware in bin format, like some of the
original firmware files are, use following command to convert to trx:
dd if=firmware.bin of=firmware.trx bs=32 skip=1
TRX check failed!
done.
}}}

And still failed after making the proposed .bin to .trx conversation.

Only way to upgrade the firmware is the TFTP based upgrade as was described above.

Note: The WEB based firmware upgrade does not work even after the upgrade to RC5. https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/447

= The Failsafe Mode and other interesting stuff =

General instructions how to recover or repair your OpenWRT box are available over the [:OpenWrtDocs/Troubleshooting:troubleshooting] page.

= Port layout =
The WE800G has 3 LAN ports and a bridge port. The eth0 has no physical connector and is a dummy port, the eth1 is the LAN RJ45 port and the eth2 is wireless card port. The br0 is a bridge port.

= Client Mode =
Out of box the WE800G is set to client mode, but it does not work - you can ping the box from both sides just fine, but it does not let any of these packet to travel over the defined bridge. More of it below.

== Routed Client Mode ==
To put the WE800G into the routed client mode you have to remove WLAN from LAN and WLAN port bridge, add separate wifi device and put the radio into STA mode.

 * nvram set lan_ifnames="eth1"
 * nvram set lan_ifname=br0
 * nvram set wifi_ifname=eth2
 * nvram set wl0_ssid="MY_AP"
 * nvram set wl0_mode=sta

 * nvram commit
 * reboot

Note: There is no WAN interface, use WIFI instead. You may need to set wifi_proto, wifi_ipaddr, wifi_netmask, wifi_gateway, ... [:OpenWrtNVRAM:variables].

== Bridged Client Mode ==
To put the WE800G into the bridged client mode you have to bridge LAN and WLAN port, disable separate wifi device and put the radio into WET mode. http://woz.gs/wifi/openwrtbridge.html http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=6246#p6246

 * nvram set lan_ifnames="eth1 eth2"
 * nvram set lan_ifname=br0
 * nvram set wifi_ifname=none
 * nvram set wl0_ssid="MY_AP"
 * nvram set wl0_wet=1
 * nvram set wl0_mode=wet

 * nvram commit
 * reboot

Note1: Somehow I didn't get this mode going before I installed and then removed the WL package. I wonder why?

Note2: There is no WAN interface, only LAN is in use. You may need to set lan_proto, lan_ipaddr, lan_netmask, lan_gateway, ... [:OpenWrtNVRAM:variables].

Note3: The "nvram set wl0_wet=1" does prove helpful in client mode, but do not leave it is for other modes as this will make the box unstable, use "nvram unset wl0_wet".

= AP Mode =
Freshly updated WE800G should go into AP mode (bridged) just by setting the AP mode (nvram set wl0_mode=ap; nvram commit; reboot).

== Routed AP Mode ==
To put the WE800G into the routed AP mode you have to remove WLAN from LAN and WLAN port bridge, add separate wifi device and put the radio into AP mode.

 * nvram set lan_ifnames="eth1"
 * nvram set lan_ifname=br0
 * nvram set wifi_ifname=eth2
 * nvram set wl0_ssid="MY_AP"
 * nvram set wl0_mode=ap

 * nvram commit
 * reboot

Note: There is no WAN interface, use WIFI instead. You may need to set wifi_proto, wifi_ipaddr, wifi_netmask, wifi_gateway, ... [:OpenWrtNVRAM:variables].

== Bridged AP Mode ==
To put the WE800G into the bridged AP mode you have to bridge LAN and WLAN port, disable separate wifi device and put the radio into AP mode.

 * nvram set lan_ifnames="eth1 eth2"
 * nvram set lan_ifname=br0
 * nvram set wifi_ifname=none
 * nvram set wl0_ssid="MY_AP"
 * nvram set wl0_mode=ap

 * nvram commit
 * reboot

Note: There is no WAN interface, only LAN is in use. You may need to set lan_proto, lan_ipaddr, lan_netmask, lan_gateway, ... [:OpenWrtNVRAM:variables].
