= External Documentation =
OpenWRT uses, both officially and unofficially, many third-party components with only minimal changes.  Often, additional documentation is provided by the creators of these components.
== BusyBox ==
OpenWRT uses [http://www.busybox.net/ BusyBox] to implement most of the normal Unix commands.  Instead of having a collection of separate binaries, BusyBox condensed them into one.  Executables like ls and grep are merely symbolic links to the BusyBox binary.

== Dnsmasq ==
In order to handle various OpenWrt configurations, the dnsmasq init script is quite complex; however, documentation on all the options passed to dnsmasq is available.
