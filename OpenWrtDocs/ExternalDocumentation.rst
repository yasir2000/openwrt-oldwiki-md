= External Documentation =
OpenWRT uses, both officially and unofficially, many third party components with only minimal changes.  Often, additional documentation is provided by the creators of these components.
== BusyBox ==
OpenWRT uses [http://www.busybox.net/ BusyBox] to implement most of the normal unix commands.  Instead of having a collection of binaries, they are all condensed into one.  Executables like ls and grep are merely symbolic links to the busybox binary.

== Dnsmasq ==
In order to handle various OpenWrt configurations, the Dnsmasq init script is quite complex, however, documentation on all the options passed to dnsmasq is available.
