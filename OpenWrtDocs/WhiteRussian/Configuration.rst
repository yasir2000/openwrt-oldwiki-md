= OpenWrt Community wiki =
Welcome to the !OpenWrt Community Wiki!  As the title states, this is for all of you who use, develop with, and hack on !OpenWrt. (Read OpenWrtOverview if you are new to the world of !OpenWrt ).

This, the public face of !OpenWrt is changing so don't be surprised if you find stuff moving around on you.

!OpenWrt is an open source project to create a free embedded operating system for network devices.

!OpenWrt is not tied to any particular device.  You can install the software on a wide range of [:TableOfHardware:Devices].  Device developers can easily add new devices.  Software developers can add new [:OpenWrtDocs/Packages:packages] which can be built and run on all of the supported devices.

Please join us on the !OpenWrt team.

The currently active release is [http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/7.09/ 7.09], code named Kamikaze. Whiterussian [http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=9326 0.9] is also available. It is a bug fix release and represents the end of the Whiterussian series.

= Got Questions =
The !OpenWrt   [http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/docs/openwrt.html manual] and [:Faq:FAQ] can usually answer most questions.
