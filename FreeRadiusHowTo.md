This documents explains what a RADIUS is, and how to install FreeRADIUS
on OpenWRT.

= RADIUS =

:   . What is radius? It stands for "Remote Authentication Dial In User
    Service" with the primary functions of authenticating, accounting
    and authorising user activity. In a nutshell, it allows
    administrators to say who can use the network, and what resources on
    the network. There are also accounting mechanisms to log who has
    used what, and when. <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RADIUS> In the
    context of OpenWRT, it is often used to authenticate and secure
    wireless connections (see the WPA2 Enterprise wiki
    <http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Wpa2Enterprise> or
    authenticating users on a hotspot. Use your imagination.

= FreeRADIUS = == Install == {{{ ipkg install freeradius }}} You now
have a basic FreeRADIUS (1.1.6) on your WRT and need to set up
authentification modules (usually not nessecary if the radius client
applications are located on localhost) and user database in order for it
to run. The latter is simply be the textfile /etc/freeradius/users but
could be quite simply be connected to the persistency mechanism of your
chooise.

== /etc/freeradius == FreeRADIUS refferes to this as /etc/raddb, and it
contans a bunch of files:

=== radiudd.conf === example:

{{{
===

=== clients.conf === example:

{{{
===

=== users === {{{ \# Example Configuration DEFAULT Group == "disabled",
Auth-Type := Reject Reply-Message = "Your account has been disabled."

\# Password Style testuser1 User-Password == "test123"

\# EAP Style (Client certificate authentication) testuser2 Auth-Type :=
EAP }}}
