I have the [:OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Buffalo/WHR-HP-G54-4:Buffalo WHR-HP-G54] router that was running OpenWrt 0.9 (WhiteRussian) before I managed to brick it by erroneously flashing the Linksys .bin version to it.  Now I have JTAG working with it, but I have no CFE.BIN file for the router so that I can de-brick it.  If you can help me out, please mail me. Thanks!
