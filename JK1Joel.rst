I have the [:OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Buffalo/WHR-HP-G54:Buffalo WHR-HP-G54] router that was running OpenWrt 0.9 (WhiteRussian) before I managed to brick it by erroneously flashing the Linksys .bin version to it.  Now I have JTAG working with it, and I used a CFE.BIN that someone gave me from a [:OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Buffalo/WHR-G54S:Buffalo WHR-G54S].  I loaded that on with my JTAG cable, and was able boot my router and de-brick it.  If you want this CFE.BIN to debrick your router, let me know.
