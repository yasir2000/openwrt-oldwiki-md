== Harware accelerated crypto ==
The BCM47xx/53xx (all models?) used by some of the platforms (Asus WL500GD/X, Netgear WGT634U...) have hardware accelerated encryption support for IPSec, AES, DES, SHA... calculations.
The specification(s?) states the hardware is able to support 75Mbps (9,4MB/s) of encrypted throughput.
For example with the blowfish encryption it's possible to achieve ~0,4MB/s throughput.
