== Harware accelerated crypto ==
The BCM47xx/53xx (all xx models?) used by some of the platforms (Asus WL500GD/X, Netgear WGT634U...) have hardware accelerated encryption support for IPSec, AES, DES, SHA... calculations.

The specification(s?) states the hardware is able to support 75Mbps (9,4MB/s) of encrypted throughput. Without hardware acceleration with the blowfish encryption throughput is only ~0,4MB/s.
