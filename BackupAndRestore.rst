= Backing up and Restoring your OpenWrt box =
There are two ways: image method and file method.

== Image method ==
=== Backing up ===
Here are three ways to backup your router's image.
==== using /tmp as intermediate ====
It's a good idea to put the jffs2 partition in read only mode before reading it as a device, or you could make a backup that's not up to date or corrupt. The default commit interval for jffs2 is 5 seconds. Log into your WRT, then:

{{{
mount -o remount,ro /dev/mtdblock/4 /jffs
dd if=/dev/mtdblock/1 > /tmp/wrt-linux.trx
mount -o remount,rw /dev/mtdblock/4 /jffs
dd if=/dev/mtdblock/3 > /tmp/wrt-nvram.bin
}}}

Note: I had to write "/" instead of "/jffs", otherwise it gave an error. -- Xerces8

And scp the files out. This assumes you have enough ram free on the WRT, which is usually the case.

If you do not have enough free space in your /tmp fs, you can generate and copy in one operation.  Please make sure yhou use the right quotes; double quotes (") won't work.  From another workstation, and assuming that apollo is the name of your OpenWrt AP:

==== using SSH transfer ====
{{{
ssh apollo -C 'mount -o remount,ro /dev/mtdblock/4 /jffs ; dd if=/dev/mtdblock/1 ; mount -o remount,rw /dev/mtdblock/4 /jffs' > wrt-linux.trx
ssh apollo -C 'dd if=/dev/mtdblock/3' > wrt-nvram.bin
}}}
If you did everything right, wrt-linux.trx contains kernel+squashfs+jffs2 one after the other. You could back the mtd partitions separately: 2 is squashfs and 4 is jffs2. Unlike disk partitions mtd partitions can, and in OpenWRT do overlap: 1 includes 2 and 4.

==== using Netcat (recommended) ====
{{{
plouj@linuxbox $ nc -l -p 7777 | dd of=wrt-linux.trx
root@router $ mount -o remount,ro /dev/mtdblock/4 /jffs
root@router $ dd if=/dev/mtdblock/1 | nc linuxbox 7777
root@router $ mount -o remount,rw /dev/mtdblock/4 /jffs
plouj@linuxbox $ nc -l -p 7777 | dd of=wrt-nvram.bin
root@router $ dd if=/dev/mtdblock/3 | nc linuxbox 7777
}}}

=== Restoring ===
/!\ '''WARNING:''' Restore the NVRAM partition '''only''' on the same Wrt router where you did the backup! Restoring the NVRAM partition can brick your router.

I'll assume you need a full restore, i. e. you've totally botched your box, and you have either restored to factory firmware, or bought a new box :)

1. install standard openwrt firmware on your box, if you haven't already. Set up a password so you can use scp:

{{{
telnet 192.168.1.1
passwd
}}}
2. Transfer the files

{{{
scp wrt-linux.trx wrt-nvram.bin root@192.168.1.1:/tmp
}}}
3. On the wrt box, don't forget to put jffs2 in ro mode if your're writing the whole kernel+squashfs+jffs2 image.

{{{
dd if=/tmp/wrt-nvram.bin of=/dev/mtdblock/3
mount -o remount,ro /dev/mtdblock/4 /jffs
mtd -r write /tmp/wrt-linux.trx linux
}}}
The second command will take a minute or so to flash the rest and then reboot.

== File method ==
Of course you can use a shell script and the well known tar to backup your files and some system informations too. In the example below i installed the package wput, to upload the backup to my main FTP server.

{{{
#!/bin/sh
# get the own name, to difference different WRTs
HOST=$(nvram get wan_hostname)
# create a directory, where the backup and tempoarary files will be stored
mkdir /tmp/backupfiles
NVRAMFILE=/tmp/backupfiles/nvram-$(date +%Y.%m.%d-%X)-$HOST.txt
REMOTEFILE2=$(date +%Y.%m.%d-%X)-$HOST.tar.gz
# save the nvram values
nvram show | sort > $NVRAMFILE
# save some other runtime informations
SYSINFOFILE=/tmp/backupfiles/sysinfo-$(date +%Y.%m.%d-%X)-$HOST.txt
touch $SYSINFOFILE
ps axf > $SYSINFOFILE
uptime >> $SYSINFOFILE
ifconfig >> $SYSINFOFILE
route -n >> $SYSINFOFILE
wl scan
sleep 3;
wl scanresults >> $SYSINFOFILE
wl status >> $SYSINFOFILE
iwconfig >> $SYSINFOFILE
# create the tar archive, if you created your own directories below root ( / ), add the directory here too
tar czf /tmp/backupfiles/$REMOTEFILE2 /bin/ /dev/ /etc/ /jffs/ /lib/ /rom/ /sbin/ /usr/ /var/ /www/ /tmp/
sleep 3
# now upload the tar file to your prefered FTP server
# for the options i used with wput type wput --help
/usr/bin/wput -R -v -t 2 -B /tmp/backupfiles/$REMOTEFILE2 ftp://FTPUSERNAME:FTPPASSWORD@FTPSERVER/$REMOTEFILE2
# remove the backup directory (if wanted) to free space
rm -r /tmp/backupfiles
}}}
This is an alternative backup script based on the above one. The transfer of the archive is done via SSH instead of FTP using Publickey authentification (much more secure) and only /etc and /tmp are backup. Please read the instructions at the beginning of the script. Without reading this, it probably won't work.

#
# Simple backup script for OpenWRT
# - read the complete nvram into a file
# - read some system and status information into a file
# - backups all files in /etc
# - put all files into a gzipped tar archive
# - send the archive to a ssh server using publickey authentification
#
# The script uses scp to transfer the created archive to a SSH server somewhere in the
# internet or your local area network. To be able to do this automatically via cron
# you have to create a key pair for PublicKey authentification using dropbear.
# Just run the following command on your OpenWRT and copy the public part of the created
# key (it is printed out by the command) into your ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the
# destination host. Create the key pair:
#
# dropbearkey -t dss -f /etc/dropbear/id_dss
#
# Then you have to store the list of known hosts permanently. To do this, try to establish
# a SSH connection from your OpenWRT device to the destination host. You should be asked
# whether you want to continue connection to the host after its finger print is printed.
# Now say 'y' and the connection should be established. Now, run the following command on your
# OpenWRT device:
#
# cp /tmp/.ssh/known_hosts /etc/dropbear/
#
# And then add the following to lines to your /etc/init.d/S50dropbear:
#
# mkdir -p /tmp/.ssh
# ln -s /etc/dropbear/known_hosts /tmp/.ssh/
#
# After doing this you should test if all works fine and then the script could be run
# via cron on a daily base or if your OpenWRT device isn't running 24/7 (like in my case)
# set the variable CHECK_RUN_SINCE_REBOOT below to "1". This causes the script to run only
# once and stores the state that it already ran in /tmp/backup_ran. If you reboot
# (or turn it off and on again) the device, this file will be deleted and then script will do
# the backup again. Sample cron entry for this case:
# 0 * * * * /usr/bin/backup >/tmp/backup_log 2>&1

### configuration ###
# if set to 1 the script runs only once as long as you reboot your device
# this can be useful if your router is not running 24/7
# the cronjob for this case should be some kind of
# 0 * * * * /usr/bin/backup >/tmp/backup_log 2>&1
# so it will be run every hour but it will do the actual backup only on the first run
CHECK_RUN_SINCE_REBOOT="1"
# get the own name, to difference different WRTs
HOST=$(nvram get wan_hostname)
REMOTEFILE=/tmp/backup-$HOST.tar.gz
NVRAMFILE=/tmp/nvram-$(date +%Y.%m.%d-%X)-$HOST
SYSINFOFILE=/tmp/sysinfo-$(date +%Y.%m.%d-%X)-$HOST
### end of configuration ###
# check if we already ran since last reboot
if [ $CHECK_RUN_SINCE_REBOOT = "1" ]
then
        if [ -e "/tmp/backup_ran" ]
        then
                # exit silently
                exit 0;
        else
                # mark that we have been ran
                touch "/tmp/backup_ran"
        fi

Could someone show us an example how to restore a file based backup and remove this paragraph? Thank you in advance. -- Wigy
