WAP54Howto \[\[TableOfContents\]\]

= This is a mini-howto for people who want to use OpenWRT on WAP54G. =
NOTE: If you brick your WAP54G, don't flame me. This works for me, but
this doesn't mean that it'll work for you!

'''!!!WARNING!!!''' I know two different WAP54G models. Look at the rear
of your AP. If the reset button is close to the left antenna, your AP
will accept OpenWRT. If the reset button is next to the ethernet
connector (left side of the ethernet connector), you'll brick your AP
with OpenWRT (**unless using patches made by nbd**). If you install
OpenWRT without these patches, both LAN and WLAN will die. See bottom
section for v2 instructions and info. '''!!!WARNING!!!'''

It may not be necessary, but I've deleted /etc/init.d/S45firewall, in
order to completely disable netfilter (iptables), to make the AP accept
everything from both LAN and WLAN.

This script set the basic nvram value copy all in a script and execute
it!

This script is tested on a v.1 unit!

== Warning: your WAP54G doesn't have much flash! (and can get stuck
because of that) == With only 4Mo of flash, the WAP54G is limited to a
jffs2 partition of less than 2Mo.

Some report only 2MB flash, but there are devices v1.0 with 4MB flash.
Read ImageBuilderHowTo to build a custom smaller image.

'''There is bug in the OpenWRT firmware which prevents you from
deleting, modifying and (obvioulsy) adding new files on the system when
the jffs2 partition is full!'''

The error message you get (quite paradoxical if you aks me):

{{{ <root@OpenWrt>:/\# rm /usr/man/man8/openvpn.8 rm: unable to remove
\`/usr/man/man8/openvpn.8': No space left on device }}} Alternatively
you might be able to use the following:

{{{ <root@OpenWrt>:/\# &gt; /usr/man/man8/openvpn.8 }}} That should make
some space available so you can rm the files.

As far as I know, the system should still work (you should be able to
telnet/SSH it) but you won't be able to change any of its configuration
but the nvram variables.

If you can tftp with boot\_wait on, you should be able to install a new
openWRT image, but I don't know if new install will reformat the jffs2
partition.

The solution which worked for me was erase the jffs2 partition. You will
lose all your installed packages along with your personalised
configuration files, so save everything you need first. However this is
better than having a 'stuck' access point. To erase the jffs2 partition
you can use the 'mtd' command:

{{{ mtd erase OpenWrt }}} you may need (I didn't have to do that) to
first do a

{{{ mtd unlock OpenWrt }}} Run {{{firstboot}}} to regenerate your jffs2
partition if the system didn't do it automatically after the reboot.
Obviously this

Information on flash layout and the 'mtd' command can be found in this
post by mbm: <http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=3123#p3123>

PS: alternatively, you can fill up the flash of your WAP54G on purpose
to lock it and be certain nobody is going to modify your configurations
files without knowing this trick and formating the whole partition. This
is called 'security through obscurity' and I do not advise it!

== Another experience (by AlexanderKostadinov) == I installed RC4 on 2
devices and RC5 on 2 devices. All with the reset button next to the
ethernet connector. I observed 3 types of behavior.

=== Install original linksys 1.09.01 firmware (if yours is older) ===
=== Install HyperWAP 1.0 === You can use any trusted firmware to enable
boot\_wait (preferably Feya), because HyperWAP has no telnet and no way
to modify manually nvram variables. In this howto I will share my own
experience but in this point I want to tell a better way if someone is
willing to take the risk of trying it. If you are not willing to try it
on your own then skip to the next point! So if you use the Feya, issue
in the telnet sessuon:

If you used HyperWAP then download the configuration as config.bin for
example and edit it with an editor that don't modify some symbols on
saving (hex editor,mcedit,...). It contains nulls then pairs
"variable=value\[null\]", so I guess that it is possible to move
boardtype and boardnum at the end, remove the "r" as last simbol in the
value and add the needed number of nulls to the end (must be 2 for 2
variables). Now restore the configuration to the devices.

Now you must be able to upgrade directly to RC5 with the micro image. As
I said before '''this is untested'''. (actually I've tested it later and
it is not working fine - to recover I installed RC4, cleaned nvram the
safe way, set the variables again and installed RC5)

=== Test if boot\_wait is working with RC4 === '''From this point first
be sure to have wireless connection to the device/devices'''. RC4
firmware has a modified micro image for wap54G. You must upgrade first
to it if you didn't modified boardtype and boardnum variables before. If
you can upload it by TFTP, you are lucky, so telnet to the unit. '''Now
skip one point.'''

=== workaround boot\_wait problem === As I said before, you must have
wireless connection to the device, so update to RC4 with the webif. You
may be able to access the device through lan ar maybe only through
wireless port or maybe you just bricked your device. I installed only 4
devices and all are well working now, but you should be warned. So
telnet to the device.

=== nvram variables === This will tell RC5 firmware to use a workaround
for v1.0 devices and not brick them.

=== install RC5 === I used \[ImageBuilderHowTo\] to make a customized
RC5 image with iptables, dhcp and maybe something else removed, but I
think that the micro image should work fine. All my devices have 4MB
flash, but some maybe have only 2MB... Use brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx. If you
have boot\_wait working, go without fear with tftp and your box should
be working. Else use mtd utility to upgrade. Now you should have RC5
working...

=== Some important notes === Board variables are needed to enable
workarounds-see
<http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Linksys/WAP54Gv10>.

Maybe some devices have only 2MB flash and not 4MB.

Somethimes boot\_wait works, but PMON resets some variables to the
default (boot\_wait=off), because some other variable/variables are with
some value (see
<http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=26835#p26835>). I don't know
how to solve this problem nor which variables make this mess. The unit
is fully working, but you cannot use boot\_wait.

This is why I recommend not using HyperWAP but Feya ot some other telnet
capable firmware, where you can check these possibilities with dmesg and
nvram utilities. This is to be sure in the success in 2 out of 3
possibilities.

If you have a working boot\_wait, I'm sure (99%) that you will not brick
your unit, but if boot\_wait remains on after reboot, but tftp is not
working then I recommend usind the hardware patch in
<http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Linksys/WAP54Gv10> to be
insured.

=== Another note === Wap54G v1.0 is full of bugs, but if you are
carefull and understand what you are doing, It is very likely to succeed
installing OpenWRT.

I hope that I helped you in understanding the issues with these units
although I have written the howto section in very limmited time so maybe
ununderstandible.

If you have questions, suggestions or comments about '''this section'''
of the howto, you can freely contact me via mail
\[AlexanderKostadinov\]. You are free to correct any gramatical mistakes
made by me :)

== Reviving a brick WAP54G v1 == After flashing a recent (mid december
2004) snapshot of openwrt-linux.trx into my WAP54G (v1) the device went
dead, no WLAN nor LAN activity and both the power and diag LEDs
permanently on. Yes, I ignored warnings like in this thread, stupid,
stupid. Did some more searching on the net and found the WRT54G trick to
short pins 15 and 16 of the flash memory during power-on. But with my
WAP54G this produced after appr. one second of pinging without reply on
192.168.1.1. indeed some ping responses but then the responses stop and
nothing more can be done, regardless whether the short has been removed
during the ping responses. The device does not enter a tftd wait state.
Then searched further on the net amd applied to the WAP54G a trick
described for the WRT54G by Sveasoft. I applied from a windows system
from a DOS window the command tftp -i 192.168.1.1 PUT &lt;&lt;PC-local
path to a Linksys recent .trx for the WAP54G v1&gt;&gt; a fraction of a
second after applying DC power to the device. A fraction being literally
something around half a second. This worked !!!! Give the device time to
re-install itself after the tftpd has announced a successful data
transfer. Of course make sure that the PC has connectivity to the
192.168.1.x subnet. I was about to trash the device but am happy to have
searched a little further on the net. By the way, also Sveasoft's Freya
software was not functional on this device; the LAN was dead but the
WLAN was not. Hence this could be easily restored from the Freya web
interface by forcing a system reset (pressing the reset button some 5
seconds or so) and accessing the device and web interface from a client
tuned to channel 6 with a 'linksys' ssid and all security turned off.
Hope this can revive your WAP54G !! martin, portugal

*\**On my WAP54G v1.0 (which uses an AMD flash chip at U6), the pin
short trick does work, but the pins to short are 16 and 17. --HaveBlue

Update for Whiterussian RC5

The
\[<http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/rc5/micro/openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx>
micro\] image of Whiterussian RC5 gives a full working system on
WAP54Gv.2, no more read only file system!!

The following refer to Whiterussian RC4, I don't know if it should be
erase.

As you can read on \[<http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=3431>
WAP54G v2 issues - "Read-only file system"\] thread in the forum,
Openwrt, specificaly:\[\[BR\]\]
<http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/rc4/default/openwrt-wap54g-squashfs.trx%5B%5BBR%5D>\]
get installed fine on the WAP54G v2, but give you a read-only file
system, so you won't be able to modify any configuration file, you can't
even activate root passwd, so you can't use web interfase neither.

Just telnet and any configuration based on nvram.

This is my work around:

== Reviving a brick WAP54G v2 == After reading the above on v1, and
seeing I had a v2... I knew there had to be a way ;-) Here's my (Curto)
experiences..

I was running mustdie based on 2.07, but obviously wanted more control.

I updated to linksys 2.08 (2.07 does not have
<http://router/fw-conf.asp> ... so this update is required).

I then proceeded to attempt to flash with rc3 of white russian (brcm
build)... which bricked my AP. The lights seemed to randomly flash, the
connection would appear to go up and down every second or so (watching
the connection from my windows xp laptop) and it could not be pinged,
tftp'd, or telnet'd to.

******WARNING****** THIS STEP IS NOT GUARANTEED TO WORK AND COULD FRY
YOUR UNIT ******WARNING******

I had read about shorting pins on the flash chip, so while it was turned
on, I started a tftp transfer of the stock 2.08 firmware and shorted
pins 15 & 16 on the flash chip (intel chip on the underside of the
board)... and it worked! The transfer went through.

However, the unit still would not ping... so I did this procedure a
second time... this time it worked.

I then downloaded the 2.08 source from linksys and tinkered with for a
bit before nbd informed me he had a patch for kmod-diag to make it work
on the v2 WAP54G.

I obtained he binary release, and flashed it via the web interface...
and it worked perfect.

I have since downloaded his customized image builder kit and made by own
firmware (with cif, ext2, and loop support so I can have a remotely
hosted filesystem... which will be in another document).

His files are available from
<http://downloads.openwrt.org/people/nbd/whiterussian/>

A tutorial for reviving WAP54G v2 with clear pictures of the pins are
here: <http://www.sorgonet.com/network/wap54gbricked/>

= WAP54G v3 = You can upload rc4 default wap54g build via webinterface.
Same limitations as above for v2.

== Reviving a brick WAP54G v3 == After flashing a wrong .trx, the v3
went dead completely, no WLAN / LAN anymore. I start listening via the
serial, and it turned out to be a problem with pflash, which wasn't able
to access the flash chip. The v3 version has NO intel flash chip
anymore, instead a SST brand chip (namely SST39VF160-70-4c-eke) is used.
Things got worse: Shortening pin15 / 16 on the flash chip (see above)
did NOT work either. However, there's a workaround for that:

What you do when shortening the pins is nothing more than generating a
checksum error during load (as wrong data is accessed while shortening
the A18 address line). If this happens, the device starts to listen on
its default IP for a new firmware image.

By comparing the intel / SST datasheets, you'll discover that both chips
are not completely pin compatible. On the v3 PCB, Pin 15 simply has no
connection, so you'll need to:

-   Find a point to get GND on the v3 PCB. Many possibilities, e. g. the
    metal plating of the "easy secure" button, the outer rim of the TNC
    connector, etc ...
-   Use some wire, connect a needle or something similar thin to the
    other end. Push it GENTLY on pin 16 of the flash chip. To find the
    pin, count to the right starting at the dot on the chip. Take your
    time here. If you're not sure you got it right, double check. Using
    a wrong pin may destroy the voltage regulator(s) and / or other
    circuitry on the PCB or cause other havoc.
-   Turn on the power on the WAP54. Wait a brief period (&gt;2 secs).
    Remove the pin16 short.
-   Use a .trx file of your choice. I used
    <http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/rc4/default/openwrt-wap54g-squashfs.trx%5B%5BBR%5D>\],
    which seems to work.
-   (Windows related) Start a DOS prompt. Type "tftp -i 192.168.1.245
    put &lt;path and filename of your trx&gt;. You may check if the
    WAP54 has entered the desired state by pinging 192.168.1.245. If you
    get replies, hit enter. Wait a brief period (&gt;2 minutes) until
    programming has finished.

-&gt; Steeve

Use the following interface names:

{{{ nvram set lan\_ifname=eth1 nvram set wan\_ifname=vlan0 nvram commit
}}} === Alternative Debricking === On my WAP54g ver.3 there is a intel
flash chip and the instructions above did not work. I have a serial port
setup on mine so I sent ctrl-c on boot to get the CFE&gt; boot prompt.
This gave me access to the nvram and let me fix a few variables. I just
had myself locked out of my WAP54g on all interfaces. You can use this
to set boot wait.

Another problem I've run into is that the wireless interface isn't
starting up correctly on boot. I've installed the wl binary and this
lets me shut the wireless down and bring it back up(wl up & wl down)
after this the interface works fine. The only problem is that you need
to set the lan interface to eth0 so you can telnet into the router.

-&gt; Garak

There is now an EJTAG flash utility for the WAP54G V31 with 3.05
software, it also has an original FLASH image that will allow you to
make your WAP54G original again by flashing via JTAG. flash\_panteltje,
based on work by HairyDairyMilkMaid wrt54g, is available here:
<http://panteltje.com/panteltje/wap54g/index.html> This will only flash
a WAP54G with BCM5352 processor and SST39VF160 chip (on the backside of
the board). Flashing with this utility takes several hours, but should
fix any WAP54G that has no hardware problem.

-&gt; Panteltje

I have a WAP54G V3 that has an Intel flash chip, same as Garak. Shorting
pins 15&16 worked for me. However, the IP the device was listening on
for TFTP was not 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.1.245. It was listening on the
IP address I had assigned via nvram. It took a few tries to get the
short to work. If openwrt is loaded on the device, you can use the LED
lights as indicators of whether or not the short worked. When the device
boots into openwrt, it lights the green LED. If you get the short right,
the device won't boot openwrt and won't light the green LED. Also, I
found that pin 1 of the JTAG header on my device -is- the pin marked by
the triangle. This is opposite of the pins on Pantelje's device. I have
successfully used HairyDairy's original v4.1 debrick utility with my
device, whereas v4.8 hangs early during the transfers.

= WAP54G v3.1 + White Russian 0.9 = I resetted my WAP54G v3.1 to factory
defaults and afterwards simply uploaded the White Russian 0.9 micro
image...

> .
> <http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/0.9/micro/openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx>

...via the web interface and it worked out of the box. The interface
assignment are of course messed up but that is easy to solve if you do a
little bit of reading.
