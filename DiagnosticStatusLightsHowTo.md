'''Diagnostic Status Lights Howto'''

> \* Many devices supported by !OpenWrt have controllable diagnostic
> lights, described in \["wrtLEDCodes"\]. They are controllable through
> {{{/proc/sys/diag}}}. \*A script to control diagnostic lights:

{{{ \#!/bin/sh led=0 led=\`cat /proc/sys/diag\`

\# from <http://wiki.openwrt.org/wrtLEDCodes> res=0 case "\$1" in dmz)
res=1 ;; power) res=4 ;; cisco\_white) res=8 ;; cisco\_yellow) res=16 ;;
\*) echo "Usage: \$0 Light \[on|off\]" echo " Light can be: " echo " dmz
" echo " power" echo " cisco\_white" echo " cisco\_yellow" echo " If on
or off is not specified, cycles light." echo "Example: \$0 cisco\_white
on" exit ;; esac

val="0" case "\$2" in on) val=\$((\$res | \$led)) ;; off) val=\$(((0xff
& \~\$res) & \$led)) ;; *) if test "\$((\$led & \$res))" -eq "\$res";
then \$0 \$1 off;exit; else \$0 \$1 on;exit; fi ;; esac echo \$val
&gt;&gt; /proc/sys/diag }}}*This script should be put in {{{/bin}}}, or
anywhere in the path, really. *Do '''not''' forget to {{{chmod +x}}} it.
So, if you called the script {{{/bin/diag}}}, do not forget to {{{chmod
+x /bin/diag}}}*It can be invoked as {{{diag power on}}}, which would
make the power light blink. *Other ways to invoke it: {{{ diag power
diag dmz on diag dmz off diag all off }}}*When no lighting option is
specified, the light is cycled. So, {{{off-&gt;on-&gt;off-&gt;...}}}.
*Uses:*Put in {{{/etc/ppp/if-up}}} and similar to light up the cisco
light when a VPN connection is up. \*The file
{{{/etc/inid.d/S90shorewall}}} makes the power light blink while
shorewall is starting: {{{ \#!/bin/sh diag power on echo "Launching
ShoreWall" sleep 120 \# Lockfile, use a volatile area (like /tmp)
LOCK=/tmp/shorewall.lock if \[ ! -f /tmp/shorewall.lock \]; then
/sbin/shorewall start diag power off fi }}}
