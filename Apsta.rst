apsta is a mode when the WLAN interface acts as a client and AP (station and AP) at the same time.

This is what nbd said in[http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=50245 the forum] :

  OpenWrt's /etc/config/wireless supports this mode. Create a client mode interface and and ap mode interface, run 'wifi' and theoretically it should work...

I _guess_ this works only in Kamikaze and now White Russian.
