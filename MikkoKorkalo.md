I'm Mikko Korkalo. I live in Finland's capital city Helsinki. I work
there as a sysadmin for telecommunications business sector.

I started using using OpenWrt as a hobby, but now I also use it a lot at
work.

I'm pretty familiar with Linux, TCP/IP networking and some languages
such as english, finnish, C\#, VB6, PHP and perl. C and C++ aren't
foreign either.
