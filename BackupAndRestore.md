= Backing up and Restoring your OpenWrt box = There are two ways to
backup your OpenWrt box. The \[\#image image\] method involves copying
full \[<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_image> disk images\] from an
OpenWrt box. The \[\#file file\] method only involves copying the files
from OpenWrt box filesystems.

Some of the commands in this document assume that DNS is configured such
that {{{linuxbox}}} points to the backup target machine and {{{router}}}
points to the router which is being backed up. In cases when DNS is not
available (eg: new router installation), simply substitute the hostnames
with appropriate IP numbers.

\[\[Anchor(image)\]\]

== Image method == These methods use the
\[<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dd_(Unix)> dd\] tool to copy disks byte
by byte.

=== Backing up === There are a number of ways to get disk image copies
from an OpenWrt box. If you are using KAMIKAZE you can Ignore the NVRAM
steps.

==== using Netcat (recommended) ====
\[<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat> Netcat\] (nc) is a simple yet
powerful way to transfer bits and bytes across a network. The following
steps show how to use it to backup a full OpenWrt disk image as well as
the NVRAM data.

> 1\. Start listening for data with netcat on the target machine. {{{

<plouj@linuxbox> \$ nc -l -p 7777 | dd of=wrt-linux.trx}}}

:   1\. Remount the main partition as read-only to prevent disk changes
    during the backup process. {{{

<root@router> \$ mount -o remount,ro /dev/mtdblock/4 /jffs}}}

:   1\. Copy the data from the router's disk across a network to the
    listening target machine. {{{

<root@router> \$ dd if=/dev/mtdblock/1 | nc linuxbox 7777}}}

:   1\. Remount the partition back as read-write. {{{

<root@router> \$ mount -o remount,rw /dev/mtdblock/4 /jffs}}}

:   1\. Prepare to receive the NVRAM data on the target machine. {{{

<plouj@linuxbox> \$ nc -l -p 7777 | dd of=wrt-nvram.bin}}}

:   1\. Send the NVRAM data to the target machine {{{

<root@router> \$ dd if=/dev/mtdblock/3 | nc linuxbox 7777}}}

==== using /tmp as intermediate ==== It's a good idea to put the jffs2
partition in read only mode before reading it as a device, or you could
make a backup that's not up to date or corrupt. The default commit
interval for jffs2 is 5 seconds. Log into your OpenWrt, then:

{{{ mount -o remount,ro /dev/mtdblock/4 /jffs dd if=/dev/mtdblock/1 &gt;
/tmp/wrt-linux.trx mount -o remount,rw /dev/mtdblock/4 /jffs dd
if=/dev/mtdblock/3 &gt; /tmp/wrt-nvram.bin }}}

Note: I had to write {{{/}}} instead of {{{/jffs}}}, otherwise it gave
an error. -- Xerces8

And scp the files out. This assumes you have enough ram free on the
OpenWrt, which is usually the case.

If you do not have enough free space in your {{{/tmp}}} filesystem, you
can generate and copy in one operation. Please make sure you use the
right quotes; double quotes (") won't work. From another workstation,
and assuming that {{{router}}} is the name of your OpenWrt router:

==== using SSH transfer ==== {{{ ssh router -C 'mount -o remount,ro
/dev/mtdblock/4 /jffs ; dd if=/dev/mtdblock/1 ; mount -o remount,rw
/dev/mtdblock/4 /jffs' &gt; wrt-linux.trx ssh router -C 'dd
if=/dev/mtdblock/3' &gt; wrt-nvram.bin }}} If you did everything right,
{{{wrt-linux.trx}}} contains {{{kernel+squashfs+jffs2}}} one after the
other. You could back the mtd partitions separately: 2 is squashfs and 4
is jffs2. Unlike disk partitions mtd partitions can, and in OpenWrt do
overlap: 1 includes 2 and 4.

=== Restoring === /!'''WARNING:''' Restore the NVRAM partition
'''only''' on the same OpenWrt router where you did the backup!
Restoring the NVRAM partition can brick your router.

I'll assume you need a full restore, i. e. you've totally botched your
box, and you have either restored to factory firmware, or bought a new
box :)

> 1\. install standard OpenWrt firmware on your box, if you haven't
> already. Set up a password so you can use scp: {{{

telnet 192.168.1.1 passwd }}}

> 1\. Transfer the files {{{

scp wrt-linux.trx wrt-nvram.bin <root@192.168.1.1>:/tmp }}}

> 1\. On the OpenWrt box, don't forget to put jffs2 in read-only mode if
> you're writing the whole {{{kernel+squashfs+jffs2}}} image. {{{

dd if=/tmp/wrt-nvram.bin of=/dev/mtdblock/3 mount -o remount,ro
/dev/mtdblock/4 /jffs mtd -r write /tmp/wrt-linux.trx linux }}} The
second command will take a minute or so to flash the rest and then
reboot.

\*If you are using kamikaze replace the /dev/mtdblock/NUMBER to
/dev/mtdblockNUMBER\[br\]\[br\]

You can also restore your image using the {{{TFTP}}} method. If you are
using Kamikaze just TFTP the backup you made of /dev/mtdblock1 and it
will work fine. Remember that after sending the image, wait around 240
seconds for the CPE to commit the information into the flash.\[br\]

== File method == Of course you can use a shell script and the well
known {{{tar}}} to backup your files and some system informations too.
In the example below I installed the package {{{wput}}}, to upload the
backup to my main FTP server.

{{{ \#!/bin/sh \# get the own name, to difference different WRTs
HOST=\$(nvram get wan\_hostname) \# create a directory, where the backup
and tempoarary files will be stored mkdir /tmp/backupfiles

<ftp://FTPUSERNAME:FTPPASSWORD@FTPSERVER/$REMOTEFILE2> \# remove the
backup directory (if wanted) to free space rm -r /tmp/backupfiles }}}
This is an alternative backup script based on the above one. The
transfer of the archive is done via SSH instead of FTP using Publickey
authentification (much more secure) and only /etc and /tmp are backup.
Please read the instructions at the beginning of the script. Without
reading this, it probably won't work.

{{{ \#!/bin/sh \# \# Copyright 2006 Enrico Tröger
&lt;<enrico.troeger@uvena.de>&gt; \# \# Simple backup script for OpenWRT
\# - read the complete nvram into a file \# - read some system and
status information into a file \# - backups all files in /etc \# - put
all files into a gzipped tar archive \# - send the archive to a ssh
server using publickey authentification \# \# The script uses scp to
transfer the created archive to a SSH server somewhere in the \#
internet or your local area network. To be able to do this automatically
via cron \# you have to create a key pair for PublicKey authentification
using dropbear. \# Just run the following command on your OpenWRT and
copy the public part of the created \# key (it is printed out by the
command) into your \~/.ssh/authorized\_keys file on the \# destination
host. Create the key pair: \# \# dropbearkey -t dss -f
/etc/dropbear/id\_dss \# \# Then you have to store the list of known
hosts permanently. To do this, try to establish \# a SSH connection from
your OpenWRT device to the destination host. You should be asked \#
whether you want to continue connection to the host after its finger
print is printed. \# Now say 'y' and the connection should be
established. Now, run the following command on your \# OpenWRT device:
\# \# cp /tmp/.ssh/known\_hosts /etc/dropbear/ \# \# And then add the
following to lines to your /etc/init.d/S50dropbear: \# \# mkdir -p
/tmp/.ssh \# ln -s /etc/dropbear/known\_hosts /tmp/.ssh/ \# \# After
doing this you should test if all works fine and then the script could
be run \# via cron on a daily base or if your OpenWRT device isn't
running 24/7 (like in my case) \# set the variable
CHECK\_RUN\_SINCE\_REBOOT below to "1". This causes the script to run
only \# once and stores the state that it already ran in
/tmp/backup\_ran. If you reboot \# (or turn it off and on again) the
device, this file will be deleted and then script will do \# the backup
again. Sample cron entry for this case: \# 0 \* \* \* \* /usr/bin/backup
