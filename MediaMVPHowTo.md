Hauppauge's '''MediaMVP''' provides music, video and photo display on a
standard (PAL or NTSC) television monitor using a small \$100 embedded
Linux thin-client device.

While it uses IBM's 250MHz PowerPC core with hardware MPEG2 capability
(the same processor series used by dream-multimedia-tv.de's boxen) it is
a multimedia playback device only. It is not self-contained as it must
use DHCP and TFTP to locate and retrieve its firmware from a network
connection, much like a diskless workstation.

The stock Hauppauge firmware uses the device solely to display streaming
video from a desktop PC. While third-party Linux firmware for this unit
does not share a common codebase with projects such as OpenWRT and
NSLU2-Linux, it does add key capabilities which allow this device to use
an OpenWRT device as network-attached storage. Attached to NAS-capable
units such as the Linksys WRTSL54GS, Asus WL-500g series or the Asus
WL-700, it could replace a self-contained media player.

=== MediaMVP firmware === The MediaMVP device operates by obtaining boot
information from a DHCP server, then downloading its firmware from the
network using TFTP into 32Mb of onboard RAM. The firmware then retrieves
sound and images from the network for display on the TV monitor.

The MediaMVP Media Centre (\[<http://www.mvpmc.org/index.php?pg=faq>
mvpmc.org\]) is a third-party firmware media player for the Hauppauge
MediaMVP. According to its authors, it is a total replacement for the
Hauppauge software and can be booted onto the MediaMVP via tftp; mvpmc
supports playing audio (mp3, ogg, wav, ac3) and video (mpeg1, mpeg2)
from MythTV or ReplayTV digital video recorders. It can also play audio
and video via HTTP, NFS, and CIFS and is capable of playing internet
radio via !SlimServer or streaming MP3 (such as Shoutcast). It can also
display images (jpg, bmp, png) via NFS and CIFS.

The mvpmc package is built on the nanowindows embedded platform from
<http://microwindows.org> and is available under GPL at
<http://mvpmc.sourceforge.net> with documentation
\[<http://www.mvpmc.org/mvpmc-HOWTO-singlehtml.html> here\] and
\[<http://mvpmc.wikispaces.com/howto_boot_OpenWRT> here\].

Network boot support for this device is provided by OpenWRT Kamikaze
\[<https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/packages/net/mvprelay> here\].

The functions that the network server must provide to support this device are:

:   -   DHCP - issue an address to the device and (depending on model
        version) provide a pointer to the TFTP firmware download
    -   TFTP - provide access to a downloadable firmware file
        (dongle.bin) and possibly device-specific configuration files
    -   NFS or CIFS - provide access to the stored multimedia files to
        be displayed (as network-attached storage)

The MediaMVP device itself then retrieves the media, decompresses MPEG
1/2 in hardware and generates audio/video signals for the TV/monitor.

As nanowindows is intended to provide a subset of X-windows capability,
it does follow the X-windows convention of allowing client and server to
run on different network nodes. This could raise a possibility of this
device becoming a user interface to graphical applications running
elsewhere on a LAN. At one point, an attempt to port Mozilla 1.0 to
Nano-X (as \[<http://nxzilla.sourceforge.net> NxZilla\]) or to
\[<http://embedded.centurysoftware.com/pixil/pixiloe.php> handheld
PC's\] had been made, but this effort appears to be abandoned.

=== Booting MediaMVP hardware from network === There are various
versions of the MediaMVP for wired and wireless networks; these fall
into two general categories:

The first units (no longer manufactured) were considered "non-flash"
devices in that they only contained enough flash memory to boot from
TFTP. Any application firmware, including the stock Hauppauge
application itself, had to be retrieved from the network every time the
unit was powered-up.

The current versions (revision H1 and subsequent, H2, H3, H4...) are
"flash" devices that contain just enough flash memory to store the
standard version of the application firmware. These may also be booted
with third-party firmware from a network TFTP server, but there are
differences in the boot procedure.

It is assumed that OpenWRT and network-attached storage (see
UsbStorageHowto) are already configured before beginning MediaMVP
installation.

A DHCP server (dnsmasq) is part of the standard OpenWRT configuration,
and a TFTP server (atftpd or tftpd-hpa, latter is shown here) is
installed using ipkg: {{{ ipkg install libwrap ipkg install tftpd-hpa
}}}

In all cases, a TFTP \[<http://mvpmc.wikispaces.com/bootsever> boot
server\] must be available to serve the firmware (which should be
renamed to dongle.bin) and any local
\[<http://mvpmc.wikispaces.com/mvpmc.config> configuration\] files. Some
MediaMVP versions also require a .ver file, which is extracted from the
dongle.bin firmware using dd.

Note that the web interface and telnet to the device (username root, no
password) is unavailable until the TFTP boot process has successfully
completed.

==== Original ("non-flash") MediaMVP boot ==== This applies only to
MediaMVP hardware revisions *before* H1. These devices have very little
flash memory and must always boot from TFTP.

OpenWRT's default DHCP server is
\[<http://www.nabble.com/Router-Setup-t4145166.html> DNSmasq\], which is
documented more fully
\[<http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/docs/dnsmasq-man.html> here\].

In /etc/dnsmasq.conf, the location of the firmware (dongle.bin) and the
address of an (optional) network time server need to be
\[<http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=11988> specified\]: {{{ \#
configure MediaMVP \# time server (NTP): dhcp-option=42,192.43.244.18 \#
TFTP/boot-from-LAN info: dhcp-boot=dongle.bin,OpenWrt,192.168.1.1 }}}

A static IP address may be assigned to the MediaMVP unit by adding its
MAC address (printed on the underside of the unit) to /etc/ethers

The mvpmc firmware must be downloaded and placed in the TFTP server's
root directory. For instance, if the firmware is in
/opt/tftpboot/dongle.bin, invoke TFTPd from startup scripts using: {{{
tftpd-hpa -l -a 192.168.1.1 -c -s /opt/tftpboot }}}

If the device cannot obtain the download from the default location, it
will attempt (additionally) to use an alternate port (16869) for TFTP:
{{{ tftpd-hpa -l -a 192.168.1.1:16869 -c -s /opt/tftpboot }}}

==== Current ("flash") MediaMVP device boot ==== This applies to
revisions H1 and subsequent. These have slightly more flash memory and
the \[<http://mvpmc.wikispaces.com/H2+Linux+Boot+-+NEW> boot sequence\]
differs from the original.

Instead of obtaining the location of the boot file through DHCP, these
devices use DHCP for address assignment only. They expect an MVPrelay
server to be present on port 16881 as a pointer to indicate where to
look for the TFTP server. TFTP itself is then required to be available
on port 16869 at the specified address.

On startup, add: {{{ tftpd-hpa -l -a 192.168.1.1:16869 -c -s
/opt/tftpboot & mvprelay 16881 5906 6337 192.168.1.1 & }}}

A .ver file needs to be created once, based on the dongle.bin file,
using: {{{ dd if=/opt/tftpboot/dongle.bin
of=/opt/tftpboot/dongle.bin.ver bs=1 count=40 skip=52 }}}

The \[<https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/1262> MVPrelay\] server is part of
OpenWRT (\[<https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/packages/net/mvprelay>
Kamikaze\] distributions only) and must be active in order to boot the
newer MediaMVP's. The first parameter is the port on which
\[<http://mvpmc.wikispaces.com/mvprelay> mvprelay\] is to listen; the
last parameter is the network address of the TFTP server.

=== MediaMVP Configuration === The MediaMVP obtains its configuration
from a file on the TFTP server; this file is named with the name of the
firmware followed by ".config", so for dongle.bin this would be
dongle.bin.config. This configuration can be used to mount individual
NFS or CIFS shares, set preferences or select skins/themes for display
by the device.

On startup, tftpboot/dongle.bin.config is copied to /etc/dongle.config
on the MediaMVP and executed as a startup/configuration script.

Example dongle.config files are
\[<http://mvpmc.wikispaces.com/dongle.config> here\].

For instance, to mount an NFS share and launch the mvmpc application,
create dongle.bin.config as:

{{{ \# Setup time, date, hostname TZ='EST+5EDT,M3.2.0/2,M11.1.0/2' ;
export TZ echo "TZ='EST+5EDT,M3.2.0/2,M11.1.0/2'; export TZ" &gt;
/etc/shell.config; rdate -s 192.168.1.1 HNAME=\`mvp\` ; export HNAME

\# Mount an NFS share from OpenWRT as network-attached media storage
mkdir /var/media;mount -t nfs -o nolock,tcp,rsize=4096,wsize=4096
192.168.1.1:/opt/ /var/media/

\# Mount some Win2000 CIFS drives from a desktop PC mkdir
/var/c;mount.cifs //192.168.1.142/sea /var/c -o
user=myself,pass=verysupersecret mkdir /var/d;mount.cifs
//192.168.1.142/dee /var/d -o user=myself,pass=verysupersecret

\# Add additional options here to change user interface or configure
streaming from Linux PC's/MythTV/ReplayTV and the like...

\# Invoke mvpmc mvpmc -f /etc/helvB18.pcf -o composite -S 0 -s
192.168.1.1 -b /data/livetv -p mythtv -u mythtv -y 192.168.1.1 -T
mythconverg -r /var/myth -F /var/myth/cfgs/\$HNAME.cfg & }}}
