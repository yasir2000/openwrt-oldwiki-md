Crappy but cheap (as in free) linksys DSL router I happen to have. It's the same motherboard as the WAG54Gv1 except without the PCMCIA header fitted. As such, it get's hot & the default firmware is dodgy.

= Console stuff =
["WAG54G"] shows the serial console output, except we use 115200 baud

with a working console, press a key to get available commands

"mread 0 10" displays reset, abort & SWI exception handler locations. SWI is hooked to reset switch. use "mwrite 8 <location>" to hook this handler.

attachment:AG041App.py is a file to download images from your AG041. I'm new to python, so it's not great. You need to manually specify the port. To download the bootloader, set the base address to 0x80000000.
