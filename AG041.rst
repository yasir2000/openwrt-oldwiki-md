= Console stuff =
["WAG54G"] shows the serial console output, except we use 115200 baud

with a working console, press a key to get available commands

"mread 0 10" displays reset, abort & SWI exception handler locations.
SWI is hooked to reset switch. use "mwrite 8 <location>" to hook this handler.
