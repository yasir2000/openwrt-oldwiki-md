Crappy but cheap (as in free) linksys DSL router I happen to have. It's the same motherboard as the WAG54Gv1 except without the PCMCIA header fitted. As such, it get's hot & the default firmware is dodgy.

= Console stuff =
["WAG54G"] shows the serial console output, except we use 115200 baud

with a working console, press a key to get available commands

"mread 0 10" displays reset, abort & SWI exception handler locations. SWI is hooked to reset switch. use "mwrite 8 <location>" to hook this handler.

attachment:ImageDump.py is a script to download images from your AG041. I'm new to python, so it's not great.

ImageDump.py [-p<port>] [-b<base>] [fileName]

||||||<style="text-align: center;">'''Parameters''' ||
||port ||Comm Port ||0 (=COMM1) ||
||base ||Base Address on Target of Image ||0x0 ||
||fileName ||Output Filename on Host ||code.bin ||


python imageDump.py -b0x80000000 flashImage.bin

will download the bootloader from flash into flashImage.bin via COM1
