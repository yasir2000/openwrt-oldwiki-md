\#language en == PPPOE over Wireless Howto == For anyone who has to
connect to the internet through a wireless connection, but also needs
PPPOE authentication, this is for you (me and at least one other
person!).

=== Set up wireless === First thing's first: set up your wireless. This
is actually easy.

Your wl0\_mode should be sta (do a ''nvram set wl0\_mode=sta'' ) Your
wl0\_ssid should be the ssid of the WISP (''nvram set ...'') If you want
to make sure it's working, set wifi\_proto to dhcp. Do an nvram commit,
reboot. Once you're back in, try pinging the WISP's ip (if you set
wifi\_proto), or just ''iwconfig ethX'', where ethX is your wireless.

Good job!

=== Set up PPPoE === Set wifi\_proto to pppoe, and ppp\_ifname to ethX
(check the last one, might not be needed.)

Create a /sbin/ifup.wlppp by doing the following steps to an ifup.pppoe:

> -   change IFNAME=whatever to IFNAME=ethX (wireless). Mine, for
>     example, says 'IFNAME=eth2'
> -   either change the username and password options or set the
>     respective nvram options.

=== Setting up Firewall ===

If you rebooted now and ran ifup.wlppp, your router would be on the
internet, but not much else would be. Let's change that. Edit your
Sxxfirewall so that all of the "wan" references become "ppp0"
references.

==== /etc/init.d/Sxxfirewall changes ==== {{{ WAN=ppp0 }}}

I mean, duh, but it took me a while to figure it out. Take firmware
original, and pop this line where WAN=whatever was. NOTE: It used to be
S45firewall, but I found in 0.9 it is S35. Isn't it a tad odd that
Network is S40?

=== Finishing up ===

If you want the internet to come up on router boot, put 'ifup.wlppp' in
your S40network, towards the end.

Now ''nvram commit'', reboot, and hope it works!

Your clients should be set to grab DNS via DHCP from the router, but if
not, get the DNS server addresses, and give them to the clients.

Have fun with a 25 watt internet gateway! ----\["Category/PPPOE"\]
