=ICPlus IP715C=

The ICPlus IP715C is a 5 port ethernet switch. It is used in the
Routerboard RB192 board, and possibly in some of the RB4xx series
boards.

The current kernel (2.6.25 at the time of writing, the support seems to
have been added to 2.6 at 2.6.23) has PHYLIB support for the IP175C, but
the adm5120sw driver does not know that it is attached to its port 5
(which is the port without a standard PHY built in), and so does not
pass on commands to it to reconfigure it to provide fully fledged
ethernet ports.

Documentation for the IP175C can be found at

By default the ports on the IP175C will come up in its default mode,
which is a simple bridge of all the ports to the switch. So for the
RB192 it is as though a passive switch has been added to port eth5.

Changes will be needed to amd5120sw.c to enable full operation with the
extra ports exposed as though they were normal network ports.

In addition the following config options need to be added to the default
configuration for any board using this switch:-

{{{ CONFIG\_PHYLIB=y CONFIG\_ICPLUS\_PHY=y }}}

The kernel driver has to be modified so that the SIOCSMIIREG ioctl will
allow setting PHYs other than 0. Then it includes a userspace program
based on the one in DD-WRT's DIR-300 port that will set the correct MII
registers.

See here for some preliminary patches to enable vlans on the IP715C:
<http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pathorn/ip175c/> The vlans should be set
in a new switch-ip175c driver.
