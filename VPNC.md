'''How To: VPNC on !OpenWrt'''

Some people, like students from Ghent University, Belgium, need to
connect with a Cisco VPN server in order to connect to the internet.
It's an ideal task for an !OpenWrt router to make that connection and
share it with all the connected PC's. {{{ Performance Reports - On Asus
WL-500G Deluxe (300Mhz) it maxes out at 30KB/s. - With a Asus
WL-500gPremium (266Mhz) I got 250KB/s. - Tested WRT54GSv4 (200MHz) with
Ethernet connection to Cisco Pix, 1des encryption, from NAT'd client
behind WRT to ftp server behind Pix. 2.3 Mbps down and 1.9Mbps up. -
WRT54GL v1.1 (200mhz) - scp test at 45Kbytes a second with 31% CPU usage

= Compatibility and stability = Be warned that the vpnc 0.3 series has
issues with re-keying, which means that your connection may hang or be
dropped. This is an issue that was fixed in version 0.4 and upwards.
Depending upon your environment (concentrator model, software version),
you may have significant issues with 0.3.

From a practical standpoint, using 0.4 and beyond means using Kamikaze -
!not White Russian. Ok, you've been warned. ;-)

= Installation = To install vpnc your !OpenWrt router needs internet -
obviously you first need to connect to another network than the net you
want to access with vpnc. Configure your device to use the backports
repository. See \["OpenWrtDocs/Packages"\] for instructions. Don't
forget {{{ipkg update}}} after you added the backport repository to
{{{/etc/ipkg.conf}}}.

Install vpnc (this will also automatically install the Dependant
packages "libgpg-error", "libgcrypt" and "kmod-tun"). {{{ ipkg install
vpnc}}}

After the kmod-tun is installed a reboot is required.

{{{ reboot}}}

= Configuration =

Create a configuration file:

{{{ vi /etc/vpnc.conf}}}

And insert the parameters for your connection in there. These parameters
are normally given by your sysadmin. If you only have a {{{.pfc}}} file
for the Cisco VPN client there is a perl script {{{pcf2vpnc}}} to
convert. Unfortunately the script is not included in vpnc backport
package but in full vpnc packages and kvpnc, a KDE gui for vpnc. You can
also \[<http://svn.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/vpnc/trunk/pcf2vpnc> download the
pcf2vpnc source.\] If you run into group password problems you may be
able to decrypt your password
\[<http://www.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/~massar/bin/cisco-decode> on the web\]
if it does not make you uncomfortable.

Here is an example ''vpnc.conf'': {{{ IPSec gateway 157.193.46.4 IPSec
ID ipsecclient IPSec secret cisco123 Xauth username YOURUSERNAME Xauth
password YOURPASSWORD}}}

The IP-address after ''IPSec gateway'' is the address of the VPN-server.
The ''IPSec ID'' and ''IPSec secret'' must be given to you by your
sysadmin, or try these values as defaults.

Change '''YOURUSERNAME''' and '''YOURPASSWORD''' to your username and
password respectively. If you don't feel comfortable with having your
password in a plain text file on your !OpenWrt device, you can remove
the ''Xauth password'' line, then VPNC will prompt you for the password
every time you connect.

= vpnc-script = VPNC automatically calls /etc/vpnc/vpnc-script to handle
most of the maintenance operations like routing table and resolv.conf
updates when a connection is established or broken. Unfortunately, the
standard vpnc-script included with VPNC 0.3.3 won't run on OpenWRT's ash
shell without a couple of changes. The modified script can be
\[<http://www.dades.ca/openwrt/vpnc-script> downloaded\] (updated
version that works with the LEDs in White Russian RC6:
<attachment:vpnc-script>) or you can apply the changes shown below.

The stock script uses a c-style "for" expression that we'll replace with
an equivalent "while".

The first location is in the "do\_connect" function (approx. line 222)
and the part we care about looks like this: {{{ for ((i = 0 ; i &lt;
CISCO\_SPLIT\_INC ; i++ )) ; do eval
NETWORK="\${[CISCO\_SPLIT\_INC]()\${i}\_ADDR}" eval
NETMASK="\${[CISCO\_SPLIT\_INC]()\${i}\_MASK}" eval
NETMASKLEN="\${[CISCO\_SPLIT\_INC]()\${i}\_MASKLEN}" set\_network\_route
"\$NETWORK" "\$NETMASK" "\$NETMASKLEN" done}}}

Change the first line and insert a line just above the "done" so you end
up with this: {{{ i=0 ; while \[ "\$i" -lt "\$CISCO\_SPLIT\_INC" \] ; do
eval NETWORK="\${[CISCO\_SPLIT\_INC]()\${i}\_ADDR}" eval
NETMASK="\${[CISCO\_SPLIT\_INC]()\${i}\_MASK}" eval
NETMASKLEN="\${[CISCO\_SPLIT\_INC]()\${i}\_MASKLEN}" set\_network\_route
"\$NETWORK" "\$NETMASK" "\$NETMASKLEN" i=\$((\$i + 1)) done}}}

A similar pair of changes are required in the do\_disconnect function
just below the last change.

{{{ for ((i = 0 ; i &lt; CISCO\_SPLIT\_INC ; i++ )) ; do eval
NETWORK="\${[CISCO\_SPLIT\_INC]()\${i}\_ADDR}" eval
NETMASK="\${[CISCO\_SPLIT\_INC]()\${i}\_MASK}" eval
NETMASKLEN="\${[CISCO\_SPLIT\_INC]()\${i}\_MASKLEN}" del\_network\_route
"\$NETWORK" "\$NETMASK" "\$NETMASKLEN" done}}}

Change to:

{{{ i=0 ; while \[ "\$i" -lt "\$CISCO\_SPLIT\_INC" \] ; do eval
NETWORK="\${[CISCO\_SPLIT\_INC]()\${i}\_ADDR}" eval
NETMASK="\${[CISCO\_SPLIT\_INC]()\${i}\_MASK}" eval
NETMASKLEN="\${[CISCO\_SPLIT\_INC]()\${i}\_MASKLEN}" del\_network\_route
"\$NETWORK" "\$NETMASK" "\$NETMASKLEN" i=\$((\$i + 1)) done}}}

On "OpenWrt White Russian - With X-Wrt Extensions 0.9" I also had to
change {{{ ifconfig "\$TUNDEV" inet "\$INTERNAL\_IP4\_ADDRESS"
\$ifconfig\_syntax\_ptp "\$INTERNAL\_IP4\_ADDRESS" netmask
255.255.255.255 mtu 1412 up }}} to {{{ ifconfig "\$TUNDEV"
"\$INTERNAL\_IP4\_ADDRESS" \$ifconfig\_syntax\_ptp
"\$INTERNAL\_IP4\_ADDRESS" netmask 255.255.255.255 mtu 1412 up }}} in
function do\_ifconfig().

I also had to add {{{ touch /etc/resolv.conf }}} to the startup-script
from the next section, because it got lost after rebooting.. But be
carefull with all this, I'm new to this... :-/

= Start-up Script = This script can either be placed in the /etc/init.d
directory if you'd like the VPN to come up automatically or another
location if you want manual control over the starting of the VPN.

It is a good idea to create the /var/run/vpnc directory in the start-up
script as this is where vpnc will attempt to store original versions of
the files it changes.

For automatic start, place this in /etc/init.d/S75vpnc (on White
Russian): {{{ \#!/bin/sh mkdir -p -m777 /var/run/vpnc vpnc
/etc/vpnc/vpnc.conf}}}

Another option (on Kamikaze) is to use the following in /etc/init.d/vpnc
and softlink /etc/rc.d/S75vpnc to /etc/init.d/vpnc: {{{ \#!/bin/sh
/etc/rc.common START=75 STOP=10

start() {

:   mkdir -p -m777 /var/run/vpnc vpnc /etc/vpnc/vpnc.conf

}

stop() {

:   PID\_F=/var/run/vpnc/pid if \[ -f \$PID\_F \]; then PID=\$(cat
    \$PID\_F) kill \$PID while \[ -d /proc/\$PID \]; do sleep 1 done fi

}
=

To enable this on startup just type: {{{/etc/init.d/vpnc enable}}} and
to start type: {{{/etc/init.d/vpnc start}}} The advantage of this script
is that on shutdown it will wait for vpnc to finish (and the restart
option will work better and won't say the address is already bound).

= Testing = Save the script and execute it to start the connection. {{{
/etc/init.d/S75vpnc}}}

= Sharing the VPN - Optional = An additional change to vpnc-script is
required to share the VPN with the router's clients. These changes are
already in the modified file \[<http://www.dades.ca/openwrt/vpnc-script>
here\] (updated version that works with the LEDs in White Russian RC6:
<attachment:vpnc-script>).

Add these two functions to the /etc/vpnc-script (NOT necessary in vpnc
0.4 for Kamikaze): {{{ start\_vpn\_nat() { iptables -A forwarding\_rule
-o tun0 -j ACCEPT iptables -A forwarding\_rule -i tun0 -j ACCEPT
iptables -t nat -A postrouting\_rule -o tun0 -j MASQUERADE }

stop\_vpn\_nat() {

:   iptables -t nat -D postrouting\_rule -o tun0 -j MASQUERADE iptables
    -D forwarding\_rule -i tun0 -j ACCEPT iptables -D forwarding\_rule
    -o tun0 -j ACCEPT

}
=

These functions should be called right after the connection is
established and just before it is torn down. The "connect" and
"disconnect" cases at the end of the vpnc-script should be modified to
look like this if you want to share the vpn: {{{ connect) do\_connect
start\_vpn\_nat ;; disconnect) stop\_vpn\_nat do\_disconnect ;;}}}

The connection can be stopped by killing the vpnc process and then
restarted: {{{ kill cat /var/run/vpnc/pid /etc/init.d/S75vpnc}}}

= Visual Indicator - Optional = With RC5 (and RC6), the Cisco LED that
is on some Linksys units can be used as an up/down/error indicator. If
you \[<http://www.dades.ca/openwrt/vpnc-script> downloaded\] the
modified vpnc-script (or the one for RC6 <attachment:vpnc-script>) then
you already have these changes and can skip down to S99done below.

== vpnc-script changes == Add these functions to the vpnc-script (for
RC5 only): {{{ \# LED Codes \# 0x01 - DMZ \# 0x04 - Power flashing \#
0x08 - Cisco White \# 0x10 - Cisco Orange \# pend=0x10 conn=0x08
vpn\_led\_pending() { ledstat=\`cat /proc/sys/diag\`
ledstat=\$((\$ledstat | \$pend)) echo "\$ledstat" &gt;/proc/sys/diag }

vpn\_led\_connected() {

:   ledstat=\`cat /proc/sys/diag\` ledstat=\$((\$ledstat \^ \$pend))
    ledstat=\$((\$ledstat | \$conn)) echo "\$ledstat" &gt;/proc/sys/diag

}

vpn\_led\_disconnected() {

:   ledstat=\`cat /proc/sys/diag\` ledstat=\$((\$ledstat \^ \$conn))
    echo "\$ledstat" &gt;/proc/sys/diag

}
=

And finally, add calls to these functions in the pre-init, connect, and
disconnect cases at the bottom of the script: {{{ pre-init)
vpn\_led\_pending do\_pre\_init ;; connect) do\_connect start\_vpn\_nat
vpn\_led\_connected ;; disconnect) stop\_vpn\_nat do\_disconnect
vpn\_led\_disconnected ;;}}}

== S99done == At the end of the boot process, the S99done script is
called and one of the things it does is turn off all the controllable
LED indicators. We need to change it to only turn off the DMZ LED to
indicate Linux is finished booting without changing the other
indicators. You can make the changes below or
\[<http://www.dades.ca/openwrt/S99done> download\] a modified copy.

The last two lines of the file are: {{{ \# set leds to normal state echo
"0x00" &gt; /proc/sys/diag}}}

Change to: {{{ \# set leds to normal state \# remove DMZ ledstat=\`cat
/proc/sys/diag\` ledstat=\$((\$ledstat \^ 0x01)) echo "\$ledstat" &gt;
/proc/sys/diag}}}
