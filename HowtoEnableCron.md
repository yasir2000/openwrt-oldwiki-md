\#pragma section-numbers off = Introduction = Cron jobs are useful to
repeat things on configurable intervals. E. g. reconnect your WAN
connection at a given time.

You may know some more useful tasks for cron on your Wrt router.

= Requirements =

:   -   A standard !OpenWrt Kamikaze release

= Installation = {{{Crond}}} is installed and running by default. Follow
the testing section below and if your test fails try this:

It may be that cron is not autostarting.

{{{

:   ps -elf | grep cron

}}} If crond, the cron daemon is running, you will see:

{{{

:   1760 root 380 S crond -c /etc/crontabs -b 2260 root 292 S grep cron

}}} If you do not see the crond running then ensure the cron system gets
stated at boot-time.

{{{ /etc/init.d/cron start /etc/init.d/cron enable }}} = Configuration =
== Testing crond (optional) == Create a minute job in the root crontab
file:

{{{ echo "\* \* \* \* \* echo "Testing crond..." | /usr/bin/logger -t
crond" &gt;&gt; /etc/crontabs/root }}} Run {{{logread -f}}} and after a
minute you should see:

{{{ Jan 1 02:50:01 OpenWrt cron.notice crond\[566\]: USER root pid 577
cmd echo "Testing crond..." | /usr/bin/logger -t crond Jan 1 02:50:01
OpenWrt user.notice crond: Testing crond... }}} == Creating a cron job
== The cron jobs are defined in the {{{/etc/crontabs/root}}} file.
{{{crond}}} reads this file. You have two ways on adding a cron job to
this file.

The first one is just to create the {{{root}}} file with {{{echo}}} like
this:

{{{ echo "0 4 \* \* \* ifdown wan && sleep 2 && ifup wan" &gt;&gt;
/etc/crontabs/root }}} or use {{{crontab -e}}} (calls the {{{vi}}}
editor) to edit the cron job file. Copy & paste

{{{ 0 4 \* \* \* ifdown wan && sleep 2 && ifup wan}}} then hit {{{ESC}}}
and enter {{{:wq}}} to save the file.

The example cron job reconnects your WAN connection at 4am every day.

When done you can list the cron jobs with

{{{ crontab -l }}} {{{ 0 4 \* \* \* ifdown wan && sleep 2 && ifup wan}}}
That's it.
