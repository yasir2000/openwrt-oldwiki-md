I own/manage some OpenWRT/DD-WRT compatible devices:
 *WRT54GL
 *WL-HDD
 *Yakumo Wireless Storage
 *WHR-HP-G54
 *WL-500g

Unfortunately I have also come in contact with some less friendly (wireless) routers:
 *ZyXEL Prestige 660HW-63
 *DLink DI-???
 *Thomson Speedtouch 536

At the moment my main router at home is a "Fritz!Box Fon WLAN 7140 (A/CH)". Nice gadget ;)
