I own/manage some OpenWRT/DD-WRT compatible devices that I flashed with either DD-WRT, OpenWRT or Oleg's firmware:

 * Linksys WRT54GL
 * Asus WL-HDD
 * Yakumo Wireless Storage
 * Buffalo WHR-HP-G54
 * Asus WL-500g
I also own 2 devices that should be compatible with OpenWRT Kamikaze but I haven't verified it:

 * PC Engines alix1c and alix2c3
Unfortunately I have also come in contact with some less friendly (wireless) routers which I couldn't flash:

 * ZyXEL Prestige 660HW-63
 * DLink DI-???
 * Thomson Speedtouch 536

At the moment my main router at home is a "Fritz!Box Fon WLAN 7140 (A/CH)". Nice gadget ;-)
