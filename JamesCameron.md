I've got two PowerNOC WOAP54G units for a point to point data link on my
farm, and I've successfully installed !OpenWrt White Russian RC3, RC4
and RC5 on them. I've also got an Asus WL-HDD and two Minitar access
points.

A problem I'm researching is that with a WDS link set up, I cannot seem
to prevent clients from associating with the AP at either end of the
link. \[:OpenWrtDocs/WhiteRussian/Configuration\] section 3.4 isn't
clear on it.

I've also ported the Netrek Vanilla Server to !OpenWrt.

        source, work in progress\] (Why is my ipkg file empty? I
        probably did something aggravating to the build process.)
