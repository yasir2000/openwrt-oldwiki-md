### DRAFT! This page is a draft and does not have informations which chip is realy running with OpenWRT yet!!! ####

OpenWRT is running on several System-On-A-Chips the "heart" of every Router. To make it developers and hackers more easy, this page is focusing on the hardware, given I/Os, known I/O hacks and how to run these hacks with OpenWRT.

Chips that may could be supported by OpenWRT:

BroadcomBCM4702 

BroadcomBCM4704P 
300Mhz, two10/100 Ethernet MACs, and a high-performance SDRAM controller capable of operating at 133MHz with either Double Data Rate (DDR) or Single Data Rate (SDR) SDRAM. For advanced security, the BCM4704P integrates an on-chip IPSec acceleration engine that can deliver up to 75Mbps of single-pass AES/3DES encryption throughput and supports a broad range of industry-standard security features, such as symmetric-key encryption and authentication algorithms including the latest 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Digital Encryption Standard (DES), 3DES, SHA-1, MD5, HMAC-SHA1 and HMAC-MD5. Additionally, the BCM4704 is available for customers seeking increased network processing performance in applications without on-chip IPSec acceleration and it is pin compatible with the BCM4704P. 

BroadcomBCM4704 
This is a pin-compatible version to the BCM4704 without the on-chip IPsec engine.

BroadcomBCM4333 
802.11 bridge processor and OneDriver? USB 2.0 software development kit (SDK) in conjunction with Broadcom's 802.11g or 802.11a/g chipset. Customers benefit from Broadcom's reference design offering because it provides complete customization of features such as ease-of-use, security, and branding that are not possible with turnkey solutions. As a result, partners can leverage their existing expertise with Broadcom WLAN devices and software products to create differentiation in their end products.  (USB 2.0 technology delivers 480 Mbps of bandwidth, which is necessary to support 54Mbps wireless connections, while legacy USB 1.1 systems are capable of only 12Mbps.)
