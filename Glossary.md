===== Afterburner (aka SpeedBooster) =====

The Broadcom enhancement that claims faster 802.11 speeds. On most
routers it breaks WDS. It's unsupported in !OpenWrt.

===== failsafe =====

A special recovery mode in !OpenWrt triggered by holding the reset
button for \~2 seconds immediately after the DMZ LED lights up during
boot. While in failsafe, !OpenWrt will ignore files in the JFFS2
partition and will override the LAN IP address with {{{192.168.1.1}}}.

===== firstboot =====

A script which initializes the JFFS2 partition. It is normally run
automatically the first time !OpenWrt is booted, but can be run manually
to reset the JFFS2 partition.

===== JFFS2 =====

\[wiki:WikiPedia:JFFS2 The Journalling Flash File System (version 2)\],
a writable file system for use in flash memory devices such as routers.
It is used as the root partition in !OpenWrt.

===== NVRAM =====

\[wiki:WikiPedia:NVRAM Non-Volatile RAM\]. A partition, occupying the
last 64K of the flash chip, used for storing various configuration
information in a name=value format. See \[:OpenWrtNVRAM\] for a list of
variable names that !OpenWrt uses.

Also can refer to the nvram utility, which is used to manage NVRAM, such
as to get/set/unset variables.

===== SquashFS =====

\[wiki:WikiPedia:SquashFS The Squash File System\], a compressed,
read-only filesystem for Linux, mounted as {{{/rom}}} in -squashfs
builds of !OpenWrt.

===== Wrt =====

Generic term used to describe the !OpenWrt-compatible routers.

Wrt is also the name of the bot used on the IRC channel to display news.
