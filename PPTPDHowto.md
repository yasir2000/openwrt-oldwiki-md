= PPTPD on OpenWrt = This HOWTO describes how to install and configure
''pptpd'' on !OpenWrt.

= OpenWrt 7.07 =

Do this: {{{ ipkg update ipkg install pptpd ipkg install kmod-crypto
ipkg install kmod-mppe /etc/init.d/pptpd enable /etc/init.d/pptpd start
}}} pptpd will be running, and will be running on boot. Add a user to
''/etc/ppp/chap-secrets'' (see below). Optionally add ''proxyarp'' to
''/etc/ppp/options.pptpd''. Then try to connect from a client.

= OpenWrt 7.06 =

If use kamikaze 7.06 for broadcom distro (brcm2.4) you will need
following additional steps to get pptpd working.

-Get old kmod-mppe package and copy module to current kernel modules
repository {{{ cd /tmp wget
<http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/0.9/packages/kmod-mppe_2.4.30-brcm-5_mipsel.ipk>
ipkg install /tmp/kmod-mppe\_2.4.30-brcm-5\_mipsel.ipk cp
/lib/modules/2.4.30/ppp\_mppe\_mppc.o /lib/modules/2.4.34/ }}}

-install mod crypto and insert required modules {{{ ipkg install
kmod-crypto insmod ppp\_mppe\_mppa insmod arc4 insmod sha1 }}} -now
follow the older instructions below.

= OpenWrt Generic =

Instructions that are not specific to any particular version of
!OpenWrt.

== Install pptpd == Install the ''pptpd'' package:

{{{ ipkg install pptpd}}} This will also install ''kmod-mppe'' and
''kmod-crypto'' packages if they are not yet installed.

== Start pptpd == On some older versions of !OpenWrt, the package
installs without running ''pptpd''. To start it this once:

{{{ /etc/init.d/S50pptpd start}}}

== Configure Tunnel Local IP Address == The default IP address of the
server end of the tunnel is 172.16.1.1, and is set in the file
''/etc/ppp/options.pptpd'', with a colon after it, like this:

{{{ 172.16.1.1:}}} Change this if you want a different IP address. There
is no need to restart ''pptpd'' if you change this file, because it is
used by ''pppd'' as soon as the next connection arrives. The file
contains options for ''pppd'', see ''man pppd'' on a Linux system for
more information on the options available.

/!''ppp'' has obsoleted this option (as of v2.4.3-7). In order to assign
the local IP address of the server end of the tunnel, include the
''localip'' option in your ''/etc/pptpd.conf''. For example:

{{{ localip 172.16.1.1 }}} == Configure Tunnel Remote IP Addresses ==
Add lines to ''/etc/ppp/chap-secrets'' for each client. The format is:

{{{ username provider password ipaddress}}} Add an IP address for every
client. An example ''chap-secrets'' looks like this:

{{{ vpnuser pptp-server vpnpassword 172.16.1.2}}} See ''man pppd'' on a
Linux system for more information on this file. Take care that the
provider field matches the ''name'' option in
''/etc/ppp/options.pptpd''. The default is ''pptp-server''.

/!If you have x-wrt installed and use it to edit the ''chap-secrets''
file, it will create every entry with the provider of ''pptpd''. Also,
every time the router is rebooted the file will be rewritten so that the
provider is ''pptpd''. The easiest way to deal with this is to set the
default provider in ''/etc/ppp/options.pptpd'' to ''pptpd''.

/!For the ''bin'' and ''pptp'' builds of OpenWrt, the file will start
out being a symbolic link to a template in ''/rom'', so remove the link,
copy the template, and make sure it is ''chmod 600''.

/!It is important to set an IP address rather than use the default
asterisk. If you use an asterisk, the peer may propose it's own address,
which could cause a routing loop. This results in very large transmit
counters on ''ifconfig ppp0'' and a badly performing router, as it
spends all it's time trying to move packets through the loop.

== Configure Firewall == For your security !OpenWrt will ignore
connections on the WAN interface, but accept connection from a client on
the LAN or wireless interfaces. If your client is to connect on the WAN
interface, edit the ''/etc/firewall.user'' file and add the following:

{{{ \#\#\# Allow PPTP control connections from WAN iptables -t nat -A
prerouting\_rule -i \$WAN -p tcp --dport 1723 -j ACCEPT iptables -A
input\_rule -i \$WAN -p tcp --dport 1723 -j ACCEPT \#\#\# Allow GRE
protocol (used by PPTP data stream) iptables -A output\_rule -p 47 -j
ACCEPT iptables -A input\_rule -p 47 -j ACCEPT }}} See the
\["OpenWrtDocs/WhiteRussian/Configuration"\] section ''iptables -
Firewall'' for more help with firewall configuration.

== Test Connection == Tell a client to connect to the PPTP server, using
the username and password you set in ''chap-secrets''.

The connection should work, ping between the client and the server
should work, but you may have to do some more configuring to let the
client use your PPTP server as a gateway to the internet, or to see
inside your LAN. See the routing section below.

== Configure Debug Logging == If you have problems making a connection,
increase the amount of information logged:

> -   edit ''/etc/pptpd.conf'' and add the line ''debug'', and restart
>     ''pptpd'' using ''/etc/init.d/S50pptpd stop'' followed by
>     ''/etc/init.d/S50pptpd start'',
> -   edit ''/etc/ppp/options.pptpd'' and add the line ''debug'', and
>     the line ''logfile "/tmp/pptpd.log"'' ... these changes take
>     effect on next client connection, there is no need to restart
>     ''pptpd''.

To understand the ''pppd'' debug log, read these key sections of the
PPTP Client Diagnosis HOWTO:

> -   \[<http://pptpclient.sourceforge.net/howto-diagnosis.phtml#confreqacknakrej>
>     What does ConfReq, ConfAck, ConfNak, and ConfRej mean?\]
> -   \[<http://pptpclient.sourceforge.net/howto-diagnosis.phtml#mppe_bits>
>     What are those CCP MPPE bitmasks?\]

== Configure Routing == While we now have a VPN ready where the clients
can connect to the !OpenWrt router we might want to allow the clients to
see inside the LAN. Of course we can alway give appropriate routes to
server and clients but there's another way. In our example we have a LAN
network 192.168.0.1/24 on the LAN port of our router. We want multiple
clients to connect to the ''pptpd'' server and be able to connect to the
LAN without the need of client routes. This is especially useful for
Windows machines as they either route everything through the ''pptpd''
tunnel or nothing and we want them to be able to connect without much
configuration hassle for the users. We will use ''proxyarp'' for that
purpose and add the following line to ''/etc/ppp/options.pptpd'':

{{{ proxyarp }}} When the next client connection arrives you should see
something like:

{{{ found interface vlan0 for proxy arp }}} in the logs. The kernel will
now answer arp requests for the clients connected through the PPTP
tunnel and thus the packets are routed correctly to either the ppp+
device or vlan0. We will have to add additional iptables rules of course
(again given without any guarantee of safety, please correct this if you
know better):

{{{ \#\#\# VPN Section iptables -A forwarding\_rule -s 192.168.0.0/24 -d
192.168.0.0/24 -j ACCEPT iptables -A output\_rule -o ppp+ -s
192.168.0.0/24 -d 192.168.0.0/24 -j ACCEPT iptables -A input\_rule -i
ppp+ -s 192.168.0.0/24 -d 192.168.0.0/24 -j ACCEPT \# allow VPN
connections to get out WAN interface (to internet) iptables -A
forwarding\_rule -i ppp+ -o \$WAN -j ACCEPT }}} I had better luck with
this:

{{{ \#\#\# VPN Section iptables -A forwarding\_rule -s 172.16.1.0/24 -d
192.168.1.0/24 -j ACCEPT iptables -A forwarding\_rule -s 192.168.1.0/24
-d 172.16.1.0/24 -j ACCEPT }}} It alows two way communication. NOTE: The
ip address range in the iptables section above is the LAN ip address
range.

== Setup for Windows filesharing == If you have Windows PPTP clients and
you want them to be able to access file shares on the LAN, you need to
set the IP addresses of the PPTP clients to be on the same subnet as the
LAN. This is because of a limitation in proxyarp. They also cannot be on
the same subnet as the local addresses of the PPTP clients. For example,
if your PPTP clients have addresses in the 192.168.0.0/24 subnet, you
can set you LAN to be 192.168.30.0/24 with DCHP assigning
192.168.30.50-192.168.30.100, but be careful that your PPTP clients'
subnets are not in the 192.168.0.0 range. You would be better off
selecting something in the 172.16.0.0/12 range (such as 172.18 for your
LAN and 172.19 for the VPN clients with a bitmask of 16, i.e.
255.255.0.0). You can set the IP address of the PPTP server to be
192.168.30.200 by adding the following line to /etc/ppp/options.pptpd:

{{{ 192.168.30.200: }}} You can then assign the client IP address
beginning with 192.168.30.201. Use the following settings for VPN in
/etc/firewall.user.

{{{ \#\#\# VPN Section iptables -A forwarding\_rule -s 192.168.30.0/24
-d 192.168.30.0/24 -j ACCEPT iptables -A output\_rule -o ppp+ -s
192.168.30.0/24 -d 192.168.30.0/24 -j ACCEPT iptables -A input\_rule -i
ppp+ -s 192.168.30.0/24 -d 192.168.30.0/24 -j ACCEPT \# allow VPN
connections to get out WAN interface (to internet) iptables -A
forwarding\_rule -i ppp+ -o \$WAN -j ACCEPT }}} You will now be able to
access file shares by IP address. For example, you can type

{{{ \\192.168.30.50 }}} into the address bar of Windows Explorer.
Network neighborhood still doesn't detect available computers. If anyone
knows how to make this work please post the instructions here. The
desired configuration would have automatic detection and population, so
there is no need to edit host files. I tried following
\[<http://poptop.sourceforge.net/dox/replacing-windows-pptp-with-linux-howto.phtml>
instructions\] for setting up samba to run as a WINS server but I
couldn't get it to work. Perhaps this is because OpenWrt is running an
older version of samba that was selected because it has a smaller memory
footprint.

==&gt; In general the way for computers to appear in Net-Hood is to have
server (master browser) to populate browse list across networks + have
hosts or lmhosts file setup on client machines(that is only way I
discovered so far). For samba servers you need to have config options in
smb.conf: (ip address of router/name of workgroup), but I'm not sure how
it works on wrt (as it only have cups I couldn't get them installed due
to space limitation) remote announce = 192.168.11.1/UR-WG-NAME and hosts
file in windoze (c:WindowsSystem32driversetchosts) like 192.168.11.10
mypc mypc.behind-wrt54g.org ..

==&gt; Other way way for computers to appear in Net-Hood is to use on
router side utility called ''bcrelay''. ''Bcrelay'' turns on broadcast
relay mode, sending all broadcasts received on the server's internal
interface to the clients. Default pptpd package on WhiteRussian 0.9
contains pptpd version 1.3.0 compiled without ''bcrelay'' support. Good
discussion about this problem can be found at
\[<http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=56890>\]

Decision:

1.  Recompile pptpd with bcrelay support or get compiled by simba87
    package from
    \[<http://rapidshare.com/files/59421121/pptpd_1.3.4-1_mipsel.ipk.html>\].
2.  Backup ''/etc/pptpd.conf'' and all files in ''/etc/ppp/''. Uninstall
    old pptpd package.
3.  I put ''pptpd\_1.3.4-1\_mipsel.ipk'' to my hosting, then use
    ''wget'' on the router and use ''ipkg install
    pptpd\_1.3.4-1\_mipsel.ipk''.
4.  Add ''bcrelay br0'' to /etc/pptpd.conf and ''proxyarp'' to
    /etc/ppp/options.pptpd.

== Troubleshooting == If you can connect to the ''pptpd'' and can ping
the client from the server and vice versa but are not able to ping
anything else refer to this
\[<http://poptop.sourceforge.net/dox/diagnose-forwarding.phtml>
checklist for diagnosis\]

There is a
\[<http://www.windowsecurity.com/articles/Configure-VPN-Connection-Windows-XP.html>
Windows XP client HOWTO\] that may help.

There is also the \[<http://pptpclient.sourceforge.net/> PPTP Client for
Linux\] or check the !OpenWrt \["PPTPClientHowto"\].

If the PPTP clients are behind an Actiontec DSL Modem/Router, only one
of them will be able to connect. This is do to a bug in the Actiontec.
Apparently it locks the connection to one client. If the router is
rebooted the first client to reconnect is locked in. Putting the
Actiontec into bridged mode and using a different router will probably
bypass the problem. Does anyone else have any experience with this?
