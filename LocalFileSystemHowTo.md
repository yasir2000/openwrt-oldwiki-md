== Introduction ==

This HOWTO describes how to manage local filesystems on your router, and
how you can access this filesystem on remote machines.

== Creating Local Filesystem ==

There are several types of local filesystem:

> -   all !OpenWrt devices can support a small memory based filesystem,
>     the contents of which are lost on reboot ... create files in /tmp,
> -   all !OpenWrt devices can support a small flash based filesystem,
>     the contents of which are kept across reboots, but changes to
>     which may reduce the remaining endurance of the flash memory chips
>     ... create files in /,
> -   some !OpenWrt devices can support USB storage based filesystems,
>     see UsbStorageHowto for how to configure !OpenWrt for USB storage,
> -   some !OpenWrt devices can support IDE storage based filesystems,
>     see IdeStorageHowTo for how to configure !OpenWrt for IDE storage,

=== Configure Block Device ===

> -   skip this subsection if you wish to use the memory or flash
>     filesystem,
> -   for USB storage, see UsbStorageHowto,
> -   for IDE storage, see IdeStorageHowTo,
>
> \* for USB or IDE, the file ''/proc/partitions'' will show the
> unpartitioned disk space, for example for an 80GB IDE disk on an Asus
> WL-HDD: {{{

major minor \#blocks name

> 3 0 78150744 ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/disc

}}}

=== Partition Block Device ===

> \* configure your device to use the backports repository, see
> \["OpenWrtDocs/Packages"\] for instructions, then install the
> ''fdisk'' package: {{{

ipkg install fdisk }}} \* run ''fdisk BLOCKDEVICE'', \* create
partitions, write, exit, \* check that ''/proc/partitions'' has been
updated to show the partitions created, for example: {{{ major minor
\#blocks name

> 3 0 78150744 ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/disc 3 1 39053983
> ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part1 3 2 39054015
> ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part2 3 3 40162
> ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part3

}}}

=== Configure Swap Partition (Optional) ===

> -   install the ''swap-utils'' package
>     (<http://downloads.openwrt.org/backports/rc5/swap-utils_2.12r-1_mipsel.ipk>),
> -   run ''mkswap PARTITION'', where PARTITION is the partition block
>     device you wish to use as swap partition,
> -   write an init.d script to run ''swapon PARTITION'',
> -   test the script before rebooting,

=== Create Filesystem ===

> \* configure your device to use the backports repository, see
> \["OpenWrtDocs/Packages"\] for instructions, then install the
> ''e2fsprogs'' package: {{{

ipkg install e2fsprogs }}} \* create a symbolic link required by
''mke2fs'', using the command ''ln -s /proc/mounts /etc/mtab'', \* run
''mke2fs -j PARTITION'', where PARTITION is the partition block device
you wish to use for the filesystem,

=== Check Filesystem on Reboot ===

> -   write an init.d script to run ''e2fsck PARTITION'',
> -   test the script before rebooting,
> -   ''e2fsck'' may fail on large disks if there is not enough memory,
>     consider adding a swap partition, even if it is only used during
>     ''e2fsck'',

=== Mount Filesystem on Reboot ===

> -   write an init.d script to run ''mount -t ext3 PARTITION'',
> -   test the script before rebooting,
> -   an example mount script with two external usb storage disks (e.g.
>     with \["OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Linksys/NSLU2"\]){{{

MOUNT\_DEVICES="sda1 sdb1" j=1

start() {

:   

    for DEVICE in \$MOUNT\_DEVICES

    :   

        do

        :   if \[ -e /dev/\$DEVICE \] then mkdir -p /mnt/media\$j chown
            nobody:nogroup /mnt/media\$j mount /dev/\$DEVICE
            /mnt/media\$j sleep 1 fi j=\`expr \$j + 1\`

        done

}

stop() {

:   

    for DEVICE in \$MOUNT\_DEVICES

    :   

        do

        :   if \[ -e /dev/\$DEVICE \] then umount /mnt/media\$j sleep 1
            fi j=\`expr \$j + 1\`

        done

}

== Sharing Local Filesystem ==

You may wish to be able to access the !OpenWrt local filesystem from
remote hosts. There are several methods available.

=== NFS ===

> -   install the ''nfs-server'' package,
> -   configure ''/etc/exports'' file,
> -   reboot.

Note: there is no need to install ''kmod-nfs'', as this is only used for
mounting remote filesystems over NFS. See RemoteFileSystemHowTo.

=== scp ===

> -   already installed by default,
> -   files can be copied to or from local filesystems,
>
> \* example, command on a remote system to copy ipkg.conf from the
> !OpenWrt device to disk: {{{

scp <root@openwrt>:/etc/ipkg.conf . }}}

=== rsync ===

> -   install the ''rsync'' package,
> -   configure ''/etc/rsyncd.conf'',
> -   write an init.d script to start ''rsync --daemon'',

=== Samba ===

> -   see the SambaHowto
