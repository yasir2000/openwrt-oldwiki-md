'''!OpenWrt Image Builder howto'''

\[\[TableOfContents\]\] = About the OpenWrt Image Builder = This guide
should guide you in building your own individual custom OpenWrt firmware
images by using the !OpenWrt Image Builder.

Why custom images?\[\[BR\]\] These images are for people who want to do
less configuration on the router itself, or who want to distribute the
images to friends, or for backup purposes. This list could be continued
by your own ideas.

If you are compiling from source (kamikaze), then use of imagebuilder is
not useful, instead see
\[<http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=46738> this thread\] for
build instructions. \[<https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/5685> changeset
5685\] added this feature.

= Requirements =

:   -   a recent GNU/Linux distribution

    \* a non root account (if you use root, generated image wont work) .
    .. to be continued ...

= Using the OpenWrt Image Builder = If you just want to see how the
default images (default, micro and pptp included in the Image Builder)
get built, continue with the steps
\[:ImageBuilderHowTo\#Obtaining+and+installing+the+Image+Builder:3.1
Obtaining and installing the Image Builder\] and
\[:ImageBuilderHowTo\#Building+the+image:3.5 Building the image\].

Everyone else should follow step-by-step in this HOWTO.

\[\[Anchor(Obtaining\_and\_installing\_the\_Image\_Builder)\]\] ==
Obtaining and installing the Image Builder == The Image Builder can be
downloaded from <http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/newest/>.

Download it into your home directory (don't use the root account) and
untar the tarball. After that change into the new directory.

{{{ cd \~ wget <http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/>
 newest/OpenWrt-ImageBuilder-Linux-i686.tar.bz2 bzcat
OpenWrt-ImageBuilder-Linux-i686.tar.bz2 | tar -xvf -cd
\~/OpenWrt-ImageBuilder-Linux-i686 }}}

\[\[Anchor(The\_package\_lists)\]\] == The package lists == Now you are
ready to build your own images. By default the Image Builder builds
three types of images: default, micro and pptp. In the file
{{{lists/&lt;image\_name&gt;.brcm-2.4}}} are the packages defined which
go into the image. It will use the ipkg packages from the {{{packages}}}
directory.

When removing packages just remove the line with the package name from
the {{{&lt;image\_name&gt;.brcm-2.4}}} file.

'''NOTE:''' Dependencies are not automatically resolved for ipkg
packages by the Image Builder.

Let's start with an example by adding the nas package into your new
image.

First download the nas package into the {{{packages}}} directory since
it's not included by default.

{{{ cd \~/OpenWrt-ImageBuilder-Linux-i686/packages wget
<http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/packages/non-free/>
 nas\_3.90.37-16\_mipsel.ipk }}}

Create a new package list by copying the default one:

{{{ cd \~/OpenWrt-ImageBuilder-Linux-i686 cd lists cp -v
default.brcm-2.4 my-image.brcm-2.4 }}}

Now edit {{{my-image.brcm-2.4}}} with your favorite editor or just
append the nas package with:

{{{ echo "nas" &gt;&gt; my-image.brcm-2.4 }}}

The {{{my-image.brcm-2.4}}} file should look like this after appending
nas:

{{{ cat my-image.brcm-2.4 }}}

{{{ \# This is a comment line

base-files base-files-brcm bridge busybox dnsmasq dropbear haserl ipkg
iptables iwlib kmod-brcm-wl kmod-diag kmod-ppp kmod-pppoe kmod-switch
kmod-wlcompat mtd nvram ppp ppp-mod-pppoe uclibc webif wificonf
wireless-tools nas }}}

That's all.

If you don't need any special tweaks you can go ahead with
\[:ImageBuilderHowTo\#Building+the+image:3.5 Building the image\].

== Additional packages == When you have additional packages which are
not listed (e.g. {{{nas}}}) in the {{{packages}}} directory you can add
them by copying the package directly into the {{{packages}}} directory.
After that add the package as described in
\[:ImageBuilderHowTo\#The+package+lists:3.2 The package lists\] above.

{{{ cd \~/OpenWrt-ImageBuilder-Linux-i686/packages wget
<http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/packages/non-free/>
 nas\_3.90.37-16\_mipsel.ipk }}}

== Custom files == Sometimes it's useful to add and/or replace files,
directories and links in the images with your own.

You have two options here.

'''files directory:'''\[\[BR\]\] Files, directories and links in here
would go into every image. Existing ones are replaced.

{{{ cd \~/OpenWrt-ImageBuilder-Linux-i686 mkdir -p files mkdir -p
files/etc touch files/etc/example.txt }}}

'''files.&lt;image\_name&gt; directory:'''\[\[BR\]\] Files, directories
and links in here will only go into the image you defined by
{{{&lt;image\_name&gt;}}}. Existing ones are replaced.

{{{ cd \~/OpenWrt-ImageBuilder-Linux-i686 mkdir -p files.my-image mkdir
-p files.my-image/etc touch files.my-image/etc/example.txt }}}

You can copy or create files, directories and links as you like.

\[\[Anchor(Building\_the\_image)\]\] == Building the image == This is
easy. Just type {{{make}}} and all images you defined in the {{{lists}}}
directory get built.

{{{ cd \~/OpenWrt-ImageBuilder-Linux-i686 make clean all }}}

All built images can be found in the {{{bin/&lt;image\_name&gt;}}}
directory.

Building the images looks like this (here only for the image
{{{my-image}}}):

= Some more information =

:   

    \* &lt;image\_name&gt;

    :   . This is how you called/named your image. For example
        lists/default.brcm-2.4, here "default" is the
        {{{&lt;image\_name&gt;}}}

== Important directories == Some directories inside the Image Builder in
which you would be interested in. These are:

'''Description''' | Contains the files and directories which goes into
the image (willbe deleted everytime a new image gets build) | Files,
directories and links in here would go only into the image you defined
by &lt;image\_name&gt;. Existing ones are replaced. |
