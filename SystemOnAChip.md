\#\#\# DRAFT! This page is a draft and does not have informations which
chip is realy running with OpenWRT yet!!! \#\#\#\#

OpenWRT is running on several System-On-A-Chips the "heart" of every
Router. To make it developers and hackers more easy, this page is
focusing on the hardware, given I/Os, known I/O hacks and how to run
these hacks with OpenWRT.

Chips that may could be supported by OpenWRT:

BroadcomBCM4702

BroadcomBCM4704P 300Mhz, two10/100 Ethernet MACs, and a high-performance
SDRAM controller capable of operating at 133MHz with either Double Data
Rate (DDR) or Single Data Rate (SDR) SDRAM. For advanced security, the
BCM4704P integrates an on-chip IPSec acceleration engine that can
deliver up to 75Mbps of single-pass AES/3DES encryption throughput and
supports a broad range of industry-standard security features, such as
symmetric-key encryption and authentication algorithms including the
latest 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Digital Encryption
Standard (DES), 3DES, SHA-1, MD5, HMAC-SHA1 and HMAC-MD5. Additionally,
the BCM4704 is available for customers seeking increased network
processing performance in applications without on-chip IPSec
acceleration and it is pin compatible with the BCM4704P.

BroadcomBCM4704 This is a pin-compatible version to the BCM4704 without
the on-chip IPsec engine.

BroadcomBCM4333 802.11 bridge processor and OneDriver? USB 2.0 software
development kit (SDK) in conjunction with Broadcom's 802.11g or
802.11a/g chipset. Customers benefit from Broadcom's reference design
offering because it provides complete customization of features such as
ease-of-use, security, and branding that are not possible with turnkey
solutions. As a result, partners can leverage their existing expertise
with Broadcom WLAN devices and software products to create
differentiation in their end products. (USB 2.0 technology delivers 480
Mbps of bandwidth, which is necessary to support 54Mbps wireless
connections, while legacy USB 1.1 systems are capable of only 12Mbps.)

BroadcomBCM4712 Used by:

BroadcomBCM5350 is available in a variety of configurations. The BCM5350
offers full software compatibility with all popular AirForce? wireless
processors including BCM4702, BCM4704, BCM4712, BCM5364, and BCM5365.
