Twin Aerials. 2-pin SMPSU (Bought an adapter for UK mains plugs)

When encryption is enabled with default Belkin firmware the signal is very intermittant, multiple resets & reconfigures make no difference. Used Network Stumbler to view it dropping out. I would like to OpenWRT it & see if I can still use it. I have  re-flashed with Belkin firmware, it is still the same. I note that the Davolink has similar hardware.
