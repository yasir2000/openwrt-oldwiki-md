/!Robocfg will be obsolete soon. (?in which version / by what?)

Robocfg is a utility written by Oleg Vdovikin to enable the hardware
configuration of the Broadcom BCM5325E/536x VLAN enabled 6-port ethernet
switch. When used properly, it can configure the switch in such a way
that enables each of the five exposed ports of the switch to be treated
as a separate, individual ethernet interface. Using robocfg, the switch
can also be configured to tag packets for use in VLAN enabled networks,
and to configure each port's MDI, duplex, and speed settings. Robocfg
options can be issued individually, or strung together on one line, each
new option and parameter separated by a space. See the bottom of this
section for a copy of Robocfg's own stated parameters.

'''Sample Command Uses'''

Show current switch configuration:

{{{ robocfg show }}}

Enable or disable a port (note: tx/rx\_disabled can be useful for
traffic monitoring):

{{{ robocfg port X state &lt;enabledrx\_disabled|tx\_disabled&gt; }}}

Set port speed and duplex:

{{{ robocfg port X media &lt;auto10FD100FD&gt; }}}

Set port crossover state:

{{{ robocfg port X mdi-x &lt;autooff&gt; }}}

'''Advanced Configuration'''

When changing port assignments for VLANs, the switch should be disabled
before changing the settings, and then re-enabled after the settings
have been entered. Of course, the configuration should also be done
using a serial console or executed as a script, since reconfiguration of
the switch will disconnect any current telnet or SSH session. Port
numbers followed by a "t" will pass tagged packets(necessary for port
5), while port numbers with a "u", or no "t", will untag packets when
passing them through the interface. The following example (which
configures each physical port with it's own VLAN) has been stretched out
to better show each action:

{{{ robocfg switch disable robocfg vlans enable reset robocfg vlan 0
ports "0 5t" robocfg vlan 1 ports "1 5t" robocfg vlan 2 ports "2 5t"
robocfg vlan 3 ports "3 5t" robocfg vlan 4 ports "4 5t" robocfg switch
enable }}}

Now that the switch has been configured to tag the appropriate packets,
the VLANs can be created using the vconfig command:

{{{ vconfig add eth0 0 vconfig add eth0 1 vconfig add eth0 2 vconfig add
eth0 3 vconfig add eth0 4 }}}

Now VLANs 0-4 have been created, and these can be seen with the
"ifconfig -a" command. Each VLAN now needs to be assigned a unique
hardware MAC address:

{{{ ifconfig vlan0 hw ether XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:00 ifconfig vlan1 hw ether
XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:01 ifconfig vlan2 hw ether XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:02 ifconfig
vlan3 hw ether XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:03 ifconfig vlan4 hw ether
XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:04 }}}

An IP address can be assigned to each VLAN interface now, if desired:

{{{ ifconfig vlanX xx.xx.xx.xx netmask xx.xx.xx.xx }}}

Finally, each interface can be brought up:

{{{ ifconfig vlanX up }}}

Alternately, all ports can be placed on vlan0:

{{{ robocfg switch disable robocfg vlans enable reset robocfg vlan 0
ports "0 1 2 3 4 5t" robocfg switch enable vconfig add eth0 0 ifconfig
vlan0 xx.xx.xx.xx netmask xx.xx.xx.xx ifconfig vlan0 up }}}

'''Original Robocfg Parameter List'''

{{{ Usage: robocfg &lt;op&gt; ... &lt;op&gt; Operations are as below:
show switch &lt;enablerx\_disableddisabled&gt;\] \[stp
noneblocklearn10HD100HDondisable|reset&gt;

> ports\_list should be one argument, space separated, quoted if needed,
> port number could be followed by 't' to leave packet vlan tagged (CPU
> port default) or by 'u' to untag packet (other ports default) before
> bringing it to the port, '\*' is ignored

Samples: 1) ASUS WL-500g Deluxe stock config (eth0 is WAN, eth0.1 is
LAN): robocfg switch disable vlans enable reset vlan 0 ports "0 5u" vlan
1 ports "1 2 3 4 5t" port 0 state enabled stp none switch enable 2)
WRT54g, WL-500g Deluxe OpenWRT config (vlan0 is LAN, vlan1 is WAN):
robocfg switch disable vlans enable reset vlan 0 ports "1 2 3 4 5t" vlan
1 ports "0 5t" port 0 state enabled stp none switch enable }}}
