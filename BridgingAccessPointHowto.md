'''Bridging Access Point'''

I wanted to upgrade my home private LAN, which consists of some wired
hosts and an Apple Airport, all behind a machine that acts as firewall
and DHCP server. I hoped to be able to handle 802.11G and clean up some
of the clutter - the WRT54G seems like the perfect box to do this.

The goal was completely transparent bridging of all five ethernet ports
and the wireless, with the WRT getting configured by DHCP. It took a
number of iterations (and reflash), but this seems to be a complete list
of what's needed:

> 1.  Set up the machine with White Russian, and connect the WAN port to
>     the local network. Telnet to the address that the machine got via
>     DHCP.
> 2.  Get rid of the firewall/NAT: {{{mv /etc/init.d/S35firewall
>     /etc/init.d/K35firewall}}}
> 3.  Get rid of DHCP: {{{mv /etc/init.d/S60dnsmasq
>     /etc/init.d/K60dnsmasq}}}
> 4.  Undo the WAN port: {{{

nvram set wan\_proto=none nvram set wan\_ifname="" nvram set
vlan1ports="5" }}} 1. Set up the LAN to use all five ports and get
configured by DHCP. {{{ nvram set lan\_proto="dhcp" nvram set
vlan0ports="0 1 2 3 4 5\*" nvram set vlan0hwname=et0 }}} /!Remember to
also remove lines from {{{/etc/init.d/S05nvram}}} that interfere with
this setting. This can be done with the command {{{vi}}}, but look
elsewhere to find out how! \* Up to RC5, remove the line:{{{ nvram set
lan\_proto="static" }}} \* RC6+, remove the lines:{{{ \[ "\$(nvram get
lan\_proto)" = "dhcp" \] && nvram unset lan\_proto nvram\_default
lan\_proto static }}} 1. Save to flash and reboot {{{ nvram commit
reboot }}}
