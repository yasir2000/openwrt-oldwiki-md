= Introduction = This guide is intended for beginners to Linux and/or
!OpenWrt. This guide is dedicated to installing a single or dual serial
ports on the !LinkSys WRT54GL router and !OpenWrt. This information is
specific to the WRT54GL, however, it can be applied to all routers that
are compatible with !OpenWrt. For information on installing !OpenWrt
please visit InstallingWrt54gl. This article assumes you have installed
!OpenWrt.

= Wrt54gl Serial Port Mod = The Wrt54gl has a 10 pin connection slot on
the board called JP1. This slot provides two TTL serial ports at 3.3V.
Neither of the ports use hardware flow control, you need to use software
flow control instead. Other routers may have similar connections. These
two TTL serial ports on the Wrt54gl router can be used as standard
Serial Ports similiar to the serial ports you may have on your PC. In
order to do this though you need a line driver chip that can raise the
signal levels to RS-232 levels. You can not directly connect a serial
port header to the board and expect it to work. That method will only
work with devices that can connect to TTL serial ports at 3.3V. Standard
RS-232 devices cannot be directly connected which accounts for nearly
all serial PC devices.

Once the modification is made you can have at most two serial ports to
use for connecting devices etc. By default, !OpenWrt uses the first
serial port to access the built-in serial console on the router. You can
connect to it at 115200,8,N,1 using a windows hyperterminal for example.
This is helpful because if you have problems communicating with your
router this method will allow you easy access connecting over a
hyperterminal. By default this leaves you with one serial port left,
however, there is a method to turn the console off giving you access to
both ports if you really need them. It isn't recommended but it can be
done.
