== Overview ==

A lot of information is being discussed, and development is taking place, on the Belkin F5D7230-4.  There is interest in having an open firmware running on this platform.  As OpenWRT is the starting point for most new Broadcom customers, and as OpenWRT's FAQ links to this page, hopefully, information can be provided here to those who have purchased Belkin's as well as those wanting to contribute to opening this platform.
 
NOTE: OpenWRT '''will not run''' on these boxes! They have only 2MB flash. OpenWRT images are 4MB and 8MB. You do the math. The micro version of whiterussian RC4 stops on boot without giving wireless or LAN access. The router ships with boot_wait=on, so it's simple to change the firmware via tftp without bricking it (and restore eventually the original from belkin).

NOTE2: Pre-1444 hardware versions do have 4 MB flash and 16 MB RAM ...

NOTE3: F5D7231-4 seems to have the same firmware. Hardware looks exactly the same. There even is a procedure to convert a 7230 v1444 into a 7231. (just change the firmware (look in [wiki:SeattleWireless:FrontPage Seattle Wireless] wiki))

NOTE4: The Siemens [:OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Siemens/SE505: SE505] (v2) is nearly exact the same router. It has fewer RAM (8MB) but more flash (4MB). Flashing a Belkin firmware is possible on the Siemens. The LED control is different though.

NOTE5: See http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=4929 for info on using OpenWRT with the v2000 revision.

NOTE6: A cut down version of RC5 will run on the v1444. Use the 4MB JFFS2 images. (Must be below 2MB) - star882

== GPIO ==

For v1444:
|| GPIO0 || "Connected" LED ||
|| GPIO1 || EESK (on one end of R658 on the back near the switch chip) ||
|| GPIO2 || EECS (on one end of R656 on the back near the switch chip) ||
|| GPIO3 || "WLAN" LED ||
|| GPIO4 || RC (on one end of R603 on the back near the switch chip) ||
|| GPIO5 || "Power" LED ||
|| GPIO6 || EEDI (on one end of R652 on the back near the switch chip) ||
|| GPIO7 || Reset button ||

GPIO7 can be used for a different purpose by removing C365 (v1444) or C367 (v2000) from the board (near the memory chips and JTAG connector on a v1444, near reset button on a v2000). This will disconnect the watchdog circuit from the reset button. (Pull the plug to do a soft reset, use serial interface to do a hard reset.)

== Documentation ==


A good deal of documentation has been published in the public domain, regarding the Belkin F5D7230-4.  Most of this has been in the forums (above), but some has been collated in the documents below.

If you have done something that you think might help someone else, write it up and post a link here!



=== Understanding the Belkin extended firmware for OpenWRT development ===

{{{
    In this paper the Belkin F5D7230-4 is explored for
    its availability as a fully integrated wireless 
    firewall router and VPN end-point. This work must 
    be done in order to achieve a best-practice 
    security solution in the Small Office / Home Office
    (SOHO) price-point. Where, while almost all of the
    casual risks are equivalent to those experienced 
    by large enterprise, no mitigation technologies 
    are available at an appropriate cost. By collating
    a mass of publicly available information, the paper
    concludes by providing a root shell into the 
    device, and a number of Linux-based reports on the 
    hardware make-up of the router. It is hoped that
    this information can be used to adapt the OpenWRT 
    embedded Linux distribution, for this Belkin router.

=== Attaining console access via the native Belkin serial port for OpenWRT development ===

{{{
    By collating a mass of publicly available
    information, and experimenting with a single unit,
    the paper concludes by providing a physical 
    console into the device, providing local root user
    level access, and a schematic diagram for a solder-
    less project that will allow individuals to try
    this experiment for themselves. It is hoped that 
    this information can be used to debug open source 
    firmware and to then adapt the OpenWRT, and 
    Sveasoft, embedded Linux distributions for this 
    Belkin router.

=== Compiling and Installing the GPL Broadcom Reference Firmware ===

{{{
    Belkin published the Broadcom reference firmware; 
    a small Linux distribution, designed to act as a  
    proof-of-concept and development environment for  
    the Belkin engineers. To minimize the amount of  
    experimentation required to adapt the OpenWRT and 
    Sveasoft firmware for use on the Belkin, the  
    published Broadcom reference firmware was compiled 
    to see if it was functional, and able to provide  
    driver and configuration information for the open 
    source distributions. 
    ... 
    Furthermore, this process was developed rapidly 
    due to the excellent work performed by Rick 
    Bronson.
