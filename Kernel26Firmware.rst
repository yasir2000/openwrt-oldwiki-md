= Linux 2.6 Firmware Page =

This page is dedicated to the creation of an experimental 2.6 kernel release.

== Finished tasks ==

 * Kernel26 wiki page ;)

== TODO in order of priority ==

 * '''A linux userspace boot loader [MipsExec]'''

 It would be nice if we could do something like '''mipsexec params.txt''' (with kernelimage and initrd files) on the command prompt without the need for reflashing.

 * '''A kernel26 development tree in CVS'''

 I would suggest asking the hh.org people on [http://handhelds.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/linux/kernel26/]

 * '''Setup of a basic stucture for broadcom architecture [LinuxMipsCodingGuidelines]'''

 arch/mips/mips-boards/broadcom/platform-asus.c ...

 * '''A 2.6 port of the ethernet driver.'''

 This should be relatively straight forward considering we have the source for the '''et''' module.

 * '''A 2.6 port of the wlan driver.'''

 I don know if this requires considerable reverse engineering. Some guys are doing reverse engineering on this broadcom driver, but I cannot find infos on the net...
