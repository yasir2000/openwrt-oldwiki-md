I'm Mikko Korkalo. I live in Finland's capital city Helsinki. I work there as a sysadmin for telecommunications business sector.

I started using using OpenWrt as a hobby, but now I also use it a lot at work.

I'm pretty familiar with Linux, TCP/IP networking and some languages such as english, finnish, C#, VB6, PHP and perl. C and C++ aren't foreign either.
