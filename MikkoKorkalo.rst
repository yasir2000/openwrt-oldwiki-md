I'm Mikko Korkalo. I live in Finland's capital city Helsinki. I work as a sysadmin for a telecommunications company.

I started using using OpenWrt first as a hobby, but now I even use it at work.

I'm pretty familiar with Linux, TCP/IP networking and some programming languages such as C#, VB6, PHP and perl. C and C++ aren't foreign either.
