I'm Mikko Korkalo. I live in Finland, Helsinki, working as a sysadmin for a telecommunications company.

I started using messing with OpenWrt as a hobby but now I even use it at work, in production environments ;-)

I'm pretty familiar with Linux, TCP/IP networking and some programming languages such as C#, VB6, PHP and perl.
