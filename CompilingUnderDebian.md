Debian Linux provides a great build environment, but there's a few
packages you'll have to add first. This list is for the Sarge version of
Debian, OpenWRT Kamikazee build 3268. This list is not exclusive, but is
rather those packages which are needed beyond the base Debian Sarge with
development tools. As root, perform:

{{{ apt-get install unzip zlib1g-dev ncurses-dev subversion gettext
bison flex autoconf }}}

Then follow the instructions at OpenWrtDocs/BuildingKamikazeHowTo
