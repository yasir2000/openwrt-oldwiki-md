== Introduction ==

=== What we want to do === I am using my Linksys WRT54GS as a switch
with build-in AP by default. I wanted a way to switch back to its
original router function without any time consuming configuration
changes every time. In addition, I wanted a, as I call it, lanparty mode
for using the WRT on a LAN-party (without internet). This HowTo
describes a mechanism for easy switching between the different modes. At
the end, you can just write "switchmode lanparty", unplug the power
cable, go to your friend's LANparty, plug in again and have fun... ;)

Here is a short summary for the different modes I am using:

> -   Switch mode:
>     -   WAN disabled, using all 5 ports for LAN
>     -   LAN configured by DHCP
>     -   Wireless interface bridged to the LAN, WPA2 encryption enabled
>
>     \* Disabled firewall, DHCP server and OpenWRT web interface
> -   Router mode:
>     -   WAN enabled, using PPPoE
>     -   LAN uses fixed IP
>     -   Wireless config as in switch mode
>
>     \* All services enabled
> -   Lanparty mode:
>     -   WAN disabled
>     -   LAN uses fixed IP
>     -   Wireless config different from the other modes
>     -   DHCP server enabled, firewall and OpenWRT web interface
>         disabled
>     -   Running special LANparty web server (httpd2) (for example for
>         pizza ordering ;) )

=== Requirements === \* I have tested this with a WRT54G/S but it should
work on any device running OpenWRT

== Configuration == === Preparations === \* At first, we have to make
copies of some init-scripts, because we will change their execute-flags
later: {{{ cp /rom/etc/init.d/S05nvram /etc/init.d/ cp
/rom/etc/init.d/S45firewall /etc/init.d/ cp /rom/etc/init.d/S50dnsmasq
/etc/init.d/ cp /rom/etc/init.d/S50httpd /etc/init.d/ }}} \* Then, we
need to comment/remove the following (well known? ;) ) line from from
'''''/etc/init.d/S05nvram''''': {{{ nvram set lan\_proto="static" }}} \*
If you want a separate "lanparty" webserver as I do, just create a /www2
dir and save the following init-script as /etc/init.d/S50httpd2.
Otherwise, remove the appropriate lines from the script below. {{{
\#!/bin/sh httpd -p 80 -h /www2 -r OpenWrt }}} \* Create a new
nvram-variable for saving the selected mode: {{{ nvram set mode=router
nvram commit }}} \* /!'''IMPORTANT:''' The script below only changes
nvram variables that are actually nessesary to be changed. You have to
set up all other required variables, for example these of DHCP server or
your PPPoE connection. Don't forget to change ''wan\_proto'' if you
don't use PPPoE and make sure you have a DHCP server running when
booting to ''switch'' mode, otherwise your WRT will not get any IP.

=== Init-Script === The actual switching is done after rebooting with
the following init-script. It should be executed before {{{S05nvram}}}
and {{{S10boot}}}, so you can save it as '''{{{S02mode\_switch}}}'''.
I'm sure you could write the script a lot more compact, but I think in
this form it is very straight forward and easy to understand:

{{{ \#!/bin/sh \# This file handles the switching between different
modes of the WRT, for example SWITCH, ROUTER, LANPARTY \# The current
mode is saved in 'mode' nvram variable...

case "\$(nvram get mode)" in

:   

    switch) { \# default

    :   nvram set lan\_proto=dhcp nvram set wan\_proto=none nvram set
        vlan1ports="5" nvram set vlan0ports="0 1 2 3 4 5\*" nvram set
        wl0\_ssid=wellenreiter3 nvram set wl0\_wpa\_psk=\*\**\** chmod
        -x /etc/init.d/S45firewall chmod -x /etc/init.d/S50dnsmasq chmod
        -x /etc/init.d/S50httpd chmod +x /etc/init.d/S50httpd2 \# only
        for testing

    };; router) { nvram set lan\_proto=static nvram set wan\_proto=pppoe
    nvram set vlan1ports="0 5" nvram set vlan0ports="1 2 3 4 5\*" nvram
    set wl0\_ssid=wellenreiter3 nvram set wl0\_wpa\_psk=\****\* chmod -x
    /etc/init.d/S50httpd2 chmod +x /etc/init.d/S45firewall chmod +x
    /etc/init.d/S50dnsmasq chmod +x /etc/init.d/S50httpd };; lanparty) {
    nvram set lan\_proto=static nvram set wan\_proto=none nvram set
    vlan1ports="5" nvram set vlan0ports="0 1 2 3 4 5*" nvram set
    wl0\_ssid=freedom nvram set wl0\_wpa\_psk=**\* chmod -x
    /etc/init.d/S45firewall chmod -x /etc/init.d/S50httpd chmod +x
    /etc/init.d/S50dnsmasq chmod +x /etc/init.d/S50httpd2 };;

esac }}}

=== Switching === The following little script is not really required,
but makes life a little easier. When you save it as
'''/sbin/switchmode''' for example, you can switch between the different
modes by simple typing '''''switchmode newmode''''': {{{ \#!/bin/sh \#
Mode switcher

case \$1 in

:   

    switch | router | lanparty)

    :   nvram set mode=\$1 nvram commit echo "New mode '\$1' will be
        activated after next reboot!" echo ""

    ;; \*) echo "Unknown mode! Only the following modes are implemented
    up to now: 'switch', 'router' and 'lanparty'. echo "" exit 1 ;;

esac }}}
