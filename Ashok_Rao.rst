Old timer. First unix system was a HP-PARC running HP-UX in 1991. 
First linux install (redhat in 1997) followed by 3 years of intense
BSD (netBSD and freeBSD) from 1999-2001. Was waiting a long time for
something like OpenWrt which runs on cheap hardware. 

Just started a small side business focusing on satellite, video
and TCP/IP consulting service primarily for Government.

Planning to port some nice inverse multiplexing video software to
the Openwrt platform
