Crappy but cheap (as in free) linksys DSL router I happen to have. It's
the same motherboard as the WAG54Gv1 except without the PCMCIA header
fitted. As such, it get's hot & the default firmware is dodgy.

= Console stuff = \["WAG54G"\] shows the serial console output, except
we use 115200 baud

with a working console, press a key to get available commands

"mread 0 10" displays reset, abort & SWI exception handler locations.
SWI is hooked to reset switch. use "mwrite 8 &lt;location&gt;" to hook
this handler.

<attachment:ImageDump.py> is a script to download images from your
AG041. I'm new to python, so it's not great.

ImageDump.py \[-p&lt;port&gt;\] \[-b&lt;base&gt;\] \[fileName\]

Comm Port Base Address on Target of Image Output Filename on Host

python imageDump.py -b0x80000000 flashImage.bin

will download the bootloader from flash into flashImage.bin via COM1
