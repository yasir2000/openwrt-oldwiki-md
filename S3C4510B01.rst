INSIDE WAP11 Hardware v2.2:
SAMSUNG S3C4510B01-QERO-230B EMBEDDED PROCESSOR

Samsung's S3C4510B 16/32-bit RISC microcontroller is a cost-effective, high-performance microcontroller
solution for Ethernet-based systems. An integrated Ethernet controller, the S3C4510B, is designed for use in
managed communication hubs and routers.
The S3C4510B is built around an outstanding CPU core: the 16/32-bit ARM7TDMI RISC processor designed by
Advanced RISC Machines, Ltd. The ARM7TDMI core is a low-power, general purpose microprocessor macro-cell
that was developed for use in application-specific and custom-specific integrated circuits. Its simple, elegant, and
fully static design is particularly suitable for cost-sensitive and power-sensitive applications.
The S3C4510B offers a configurable 8K-byte unified cache/SRAM and Ethernet controller which reduces total
system cost. Most of the on-chip function blocks have been designed using an HDL synthesizer and the
S3C4510B has been fully verified in Samsung's state-of-the-art ASIC test environment.
Important peripheral functions include two HDLC channels with buffer descriptor, two UART channels, 2-channel
GDMA, two 32-bit timers, and 18 programmable I/O ports. On-board logic includes an interrupt controller, DRAM/
SDRAM controller, and a controller for ROM/SRAM and flash memory. The System Manager includes an internal
32-bit system bus arbiter and an external memory controller.
The following integrated on-chip functions are described in detail in this user's manual:
— 8K-byte unified cache/SRAM
— I2C interface
— Ethernet controller
— HDLC
— GDMA
— UART
— Timers
— Programmable I/O ports
— Interrupt controller
