OpenWrt is an open source project to create a free network device operating sysem. (We need to establish the scope of the project via a mission statement)

OpenWrt is not tied to any particular device.  You can install the software over a wide range of SupportedDevices.  Device developers can easily add new devices.  Software developers can easily add new packages which can be build and run on all of the supported devices.

Please join us on the OpenWrt team.
