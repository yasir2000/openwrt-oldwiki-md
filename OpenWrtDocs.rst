### 2 problems with the above:
### 
### 1: I apologize but there seems to be no place and no link to anywhere appropriate
### for questions/problems with the wiki itself. I suggest right on the front page,
### however small and out of the way and low contrast, there needs to be _something_
### for contacting the wiki or site admins.
###
### 2: For example, the instigation of #1:
### The recover lost password procedure does not work.
### It emails you your login name and an encrypted password in a format {SHA}...
### and tells you to past that password into the login password field.
### This does not work. Luckily I was able eventually to simply remember/guess
### my password the normal way.
### As unwelcome as this comment may be in the front page, I figure it's better than
### simply creating a (visible) link to a new page, which is what I probably should
### do by rights, and allow the natural process of everyone revising that take its course.
### Another reasonable approach would have been to create a new account, or call a
### friend who knows their password simply edit the page that gives the faulty directions.
### But even after successfully logging in, I do not have permission to edit that page.
###
### Yes, I looked in the forms and didn't see anything there either, though even if there
### were something there, that's not very useful without a clearly labeled "contact us"
### or "feedback" or "site admin" or "webmaster" etc... link to it from here.
### I guess this is as good a way as any to point out the lack. Had there been some
### official place for such dialog, I'd have used it, instead of this messy comment.
###
### Sorry again for the intrusion.
### Respectfully, wiki user BrianWhite , brian@aljex.com

= OpenWrt Community Wiki =
Welcome to the !OpenWrt Community Wiki! As the title suggests, this wiki is for all of you who use, develop with, and hack on !OpenWrt. It is constantly changing, so don't be surprised if you find stuff moving around on you.

!OpenWrt is an open-source project to create a free embedded operating system for network devices. It supports a wide range of [:TableOfHardware:Devices], and device developers can easily add support for new devices. Software developers, moreover, can add new [:OpenWrtDocs/Packages:packages], which can be built and run on all of the supported devices.

OpenWrt is aimed at advanced users. If you are new to the world of !OpenWrt, start with OpenWrtOverview.  Basic end-users should also read: BasicEndUser.

Please join us on the !OpenWrt team.

= Latest Releases =
The currently active release is [http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/7.09/ Kamikaze 7.09].

The current release candidate is [http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/8.09_RC1/ Kamikaze 8.09_RC1].  While it should be stable, it should be used with caution.
