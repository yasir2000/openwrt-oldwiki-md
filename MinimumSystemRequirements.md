Minimum hardware requirements for running OpenWrt.

= Flash = == less than 2MiB == 1MiB of flash is insufficent.

== 2MiB to 4MiB == Some stock Linux firmwares fit in 2MiB of flash, so
OpenWrt '''might''' function (with severe limits on how many packages
can be installed) on these boxes.

== 4MiB or more == In general 4MiB or more of flash is required for
OpenWrt to be useful.

= RAM = While OpenWrt will function with 8MiB of RAM not much will be
possible. 16MiB is a practical minimum.

= Where do I find the amount of storage in my box? = First, consult
TableOfHardware. If that doesn't provide an answer, you could open your
box and read the part numbers of the RAM and Flash chips. Then Google
for that part number and see if you can figure out what amount of
storage your device has. == Flash chips == Flash chips have pins
parallel to the package's long axis.

== RAM chips == Unlike flash chips, RAM chips have their pins
perpendicular to the long axis.
