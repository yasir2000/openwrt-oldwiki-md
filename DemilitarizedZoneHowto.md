'''DemilitarizedZoneHowto'''

\[\[TableOfContents\]\]

= Introduction =

Lots of users requested a howto on IRC and the forum for a sample
demilitarized zone configuration using !OpenWrt. Well, here is the
howto. Take it AS-IS. If you don't like how it's written please feel
free to change it.

This example is tested with a WRT54GS v1.0 and a standard White Russian
RC4 image.

(Note for users looking to duplicate the poorly-named DMZ feature found
on most native firmwares - just skip straight to step 2.4. This is not
as proper, but allows for a "moving DMZ host", which may not be limited
to a given port. - MarkZiesemer)

This document is written for experienced users only.

= Configuration =

== Create a new vlan ==

You now have to decide which one of the LAN ports on the back of your
router you want to use for the demilitarized zone. On this page it's LAN
port 4.

The configuration is easily done by changing the vlan\* NVRAM variables.

/!'''WARNING:''' Doublecheck these settings before commit them!

{{{ nvram set vlan0hwname=et0 nvram set vlan0ports="1 2 3 5\*" nvram set
vlan1hwname=et0 nvram set vlan1ports="0 5" nvram set vlan2hwname=et0
nvram set vlan2ports="4 5" }}}

The {{{vlan2hwname}}} and {{{vlan2ports}}} NVRAM variables creates the
new vlan2 for our DMZ.

== Configure [dmz]()\* variables ==

Set the following:

{{{ nvram set dmz\_ifname=vlan2 nvram set dmz\_ifnames=vlan2 nvram set
dmz\_ipaddr=192.168.2.1 nvram set dmz\_netmask=255.255.255.0 nvram set
dmz\_proto=static }}}

== Modify the init scripts ==

Next is to change your init scripts to bring up the DMZ on every reboot.
You have to edit the {{{/etc/init.d/S40network}}} file and add {{{ifup
dmz}}} after the line {{{ifup wan}}}.

For whiterussian 0.9, you don't need to edit
{{{/etc/init.d/S40network}}}. Instead, execute the following: {{{nvram
set ifup\_interfaces="lan wan wifi dmz" nvram commit}}}

== Configure the firewall ==

{{{/etc/firewall.user}}} should look like this:

{{{ \[..\] iptables -A forwarding\_rule -i vlan2 -o \$WAN -j ACCEPT
iptables -A forwarding\_rule -i vlan2 -o br0 -j ACCEPT

\#\#\# Port forwarding \# http to DMZ iptables -t nat -A
prerouting\_rule -i \$WAN -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to 192.168.2.2
iptables -A forwarding\_rule -i \$WAN -p tcp --dport 80 -d 192.168.2.2
-j ACCEPT

\#\#\# DMZ (should be placed after port forwarding / accept rules)
iptables -t nat -A prerouting\_rule -i \$WAN -j DNAT --to 192.168.2.2
iptables -A forwarding\_rule -i \$WAN -d 192.168.2.2 -j ACCEPT }}}

Note that most of this already exists in the default
{{{/etc/firewall.user}}}, and only needs to be uncommented, with the IP
edited as necessary.

(Can't edit the file? Check the
\[<http://wiki.openwrt.org/Faq#head-74da83e07a26f01d739113dad7d8aaa31aae24e7>
FAQ\].)

== Clean up ==

Now it's time to commit the changes and a reboot your router which
hopefully comes up again with a vlan2 interface (check it with
{{{ifconfig}}}).

(If {{{firewall.user}}} is all that has changed,
{{{/etc/firewall.user}}} will do nicely; no reboot required.)

= Testing =

First make sure your vlan2 interface is up and pingable on the router.
Next thing you could try is to hook up a PC or another Wrt to the LAN
port 4 and see if you can reach its httpd server.

That's it. Have fun!
