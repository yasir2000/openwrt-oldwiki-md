INSIDE WAP11 Hardware v2.2: SAMSUNG S3C4510B01-QERO-230B EMBEDDED
PROCESSOR

Samsung's S3C4510B 16/32-bit RISC microcontroller is a cost-effective,
high-performance microcontroller solution for Ethernet-based systems. An
integrated Ethernet controller, the S3C4510B, is designed for use in
managed communication hubs and routers. The S3C4510B is built around an
outstanding CPU core: the 16/32-bit ARM7TDMI RISC processor designed by
Advanced RISC Machines, Ltd. The ARM7TDMI core is a low-power, general
purpose microprocessor macro-cell that was developed for use in
application-specific and custom-specific integrated circuits. Its
simple, elegant, and fully static design is particularly suitable for
cost-sensitive and power-sensitive applications. The S3C4510B offers a
configurable 8K-byte unified cache/SRAM and Ethernet controller which
reduces total system cost. Most of the on-chip function blocks have been
designed using an HDL synthesizer and the S3C4510B has been fully
verified in Samsung's state-of-the-art ASIC test environment. Important
peripheral functions include two HDLC channels with buffer descriptor,
two UART channels, 2-channel GDMA, two 32-bit timers, and 18
programmable I/O ports. On-board logic includes an interrupt controller,
DRAM/ SDRAM controller, and a controller for ROM/SRAM and flash memory.
The System Manager includes an internal 32-bit system bus arbiter and an
external memory controller. The following integrated on-chip functions
are described in detail in this user's manual: — 8K-byte unified
cache/SRAM — I2C interface — Ethernet controller — HDLC — GDMA — UART —
Timers — Programmable I/O ports — Interrupt controller
