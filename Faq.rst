== Requirements for compiling OpenWrt ==

For compiling OpenWrt (from CVS or from the tarball form the stable release) you need
at least a recent GNU/Linux distribution and the following programs installed:

{{{
gcc, g++, binutils, patch, bzip2, flex, bison, make, gettext, unzip, libz-dev and
libc headers.
}}}

When you get error messages related to libnvram, upgrade {{{make}}} to version 3.80.
If that is also not working patch {{{make}}} 3.80 with the Debian patches.
