White Russian (RC5 and all later versions) use a new ethernet driver (b44) and switch driver to configure the switch and VLANs. The switch driver will be configured by a /proc/switch interface. This driver works for ROBO and ADMTEK switches. The syntax of these files is exactly the same as the vlan*ports variables documented elsewhere on the wiki.

{{{
vlan0ports -> /proc/switch/eth0/vlan/0/ports
vlan1ports -> /proc/switch/eth0/vlan/1/ports
vlan2ports -> /proc/switch/eth0/vlan/2/ports
...
}}}
