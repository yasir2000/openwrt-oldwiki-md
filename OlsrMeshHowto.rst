__'''Introduction'''__

Mesh networks are networks which are self arranging and auto configure them selves on basis of topology changes in cases like one node fails or a a new route emerges or a low traffic route is availble etc.The concept of mesh network is not new Internet is a huge mesh network in itself.So whats new? Well mesh networks with wireless simply rocxx.

Well OLSR is one of the routing protocol available for Mobile Adhoc Network(MANET) or rather is general terms a wireless Mesh network.The OLSR code developed by [http://www.olsr.org Andreas TÃ¸nnesen] is the best suited for our case.

Actually if the objective is just to have a quick mesh you should be looking at Freifunk firmware or [http://trac.what-a-mesh.net/trac/ what-a-mesh] firmware which is openwrt+olsr. But if you want to do it all your self which was as in my case you can follow the below methods

__'''The Network'''__

 {{{                           Wired to Lan Client (HNA4)
                   (WAN)           |
                     |             / 
 Internet---------->Node1- - - - Node2 
                      ^           \ - - wifi to Client (Olsr/Non Olsr running client)
                      | 
                      |
               Wifi Link with olsr      
 }}}

Both Nodes(WRTs) need to have olsr installed.Same is the case for any n number of nodes participating.OLSR has to run on WIFI interface running it on wired interface is optional tho it wont be of much help.The non olsr interfaces (like WAN and wired client in the above case) are added by entering the network/ip address in the HNA4  field of the olsrd.conf file.

__'''HOW TO''' __ __ __ __ __ __ __

1.The Base Configuration:

 . The base configuration is install the olsr package on a OpenWrt router in Ad Hoc mode with Lan and Wifi seperate (ie. no br0)
  . {{{
  ipkg update
  ipkg install olsrd_0.4.10-1_mipsel.ipk  }}}
 2.Edit the /etc/olsrd.conf file
  . In the lower side of the olsrd.conf file you see Interface "XXX" just change XXX to your wireless interface which was eth1 in my case

''''''

{{{
  Interface "eth1" 
{  #IPv4 broadcast address to use.The 
   #one usefull example would be 255.255.255.255

}}}

 . Then you just need to run the command olsrd and it should take the default values and run.

3. Modifying  /etc./firewall.user      for OLSR network
Now as the bridge br0 is broken we have to add a few lines into firewalll scripts so as to have proper functioning.The following are basic rules required

{{{
#!/bin/sh
 . /etc/functions.sh
 
 WAN=$(nvram get wan_ifname)
 LAN=$(nvram get lan_ifname)
 WIFI=$(nvram get wifi_ifname)
 
 iptables -F input_rule
 iptables -F output_rule
 iptables -F forwarding_rule
 iptables -t nat -F prerouting_rule
 iptables -t nat -F postrouting_rule

# For forwarding WAN (internet) to WIFI

 iptables -A forwarding_rule -i $WAN  -o $WIFI  -j  ACCEPT 


#For forwarding  LAN & WIFI in nodes
 
iptables -A forwarding_rule -i $LAN  -o $WIFI  -j  ACCEPT

 
#For WIFI clients to connect to node
 
iptables -A forwarding_rule -i $WIFI  -o $WIFI  -j  ACCEPT


#For connecting a Wired Lan client of node 1 to wired client of node 2

iptables -A forwarding_rule -i $LAN -o $LAN  -j  ACCEPT

}}}

4.Running OLSR on startup

Well if you need olsr to run on the startup then we have to make a startup script in /etc/init.d/S60olsrd

{{{
#!/bin/sh
/bin/olsrd


}}}
