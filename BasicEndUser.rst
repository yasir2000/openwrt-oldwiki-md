Well hello, Basic End User!

You basically don't want to install the default OpenWrt load.  Why?  Well, it involves all of this nasty "command line interface" stuff that will give you hives, or at least make you very uncomfortable.

Here's the good news.  You can get a lovely web interface by relying on the fine folks at x-wrt.  They basically repackage the default OpenWrt with all of the crunchy web browser goodness that you expect now-adays.  [http://www.x-wrt.org Read all about it] or [http://downloads.x-wrt.org/xwrt go get it.]

BUT, you still need to figure out WHICH firmware you want. So:
1. Figure out the firmware that you need (search the Wiki for the model number of your router)
2. Download the firmware (see above)
3. Upload the firmware to the router.

My Basic End User friend - if you cannot use the GUI on your existing router (such as Buffalo) to upload this new firmware, well, then, you may wish to invite a geeky friend over who can do magical things like tftp.  However, if you CAN use the GUI on your existing router (such as Linksys), you will likely be in good shape.

Good luck!
