Well, hello, Basic Enduser!

Since you are a basic enduser, the most important thing for you to understand is that you shouldn't install the default OpenWrt load. Why? Well, it involves all of this nasty "command-line interface" stuff that will give you hives or at least make you very uncomfortable.

Here's the good news. You can get a lovely web interface by relying on the fine folks at x-wrt. They repackage the default OpenWrt with all of the crunchy web browser goodness that you expect nowadays.  [http://www.x-wrt.org Read all about it] or [http://downloads.x-wrt.org/xwrt just go get it.]

There are those who say, "X-Wrt is too large!"  Well, you judge for yourself.  Would you rather have 1.8 MB of data uploaded to your router and have to type stuff like

{{{
        ntpclient -c 1 -d -s -h 0.pool.ntp.org}}}
Or would you rather upload 1.9 MB and use buttons and clickable fields to set the date and time? If you answered 1.8 MB, this is the wrong guide for you!

If you're still here, you now need to figure out which firmware you want (since it's very hard to upload firmware that you haven't chosen yet). So:

 1. Search the Wiki with the model number of your router to determine which file you need.

 2. Download the corresponding firmware from x-wrt rather than directly from the openwrt.org site.

 3. Upload the firmware to the router.

Some devices, such as Buffalo routers, will not allow you to upload third-party firmware through the web interface. In these cases, you may wish to invite a geeky friend over who understands arcane mumbo-jumbo like default IP addressing schemes and can do magical things like TFTP. However, if you can use the web interface on your router (such as Cisco's Linksys -- [http://splashofstyle.com/archives/2007/04/13/configuring-linksys-router/ here is a good example]), you will likely be in good shape to upload the firmware on your own.

Good luck!
