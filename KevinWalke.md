I will be working towards creating a far more structured TableOfHardware
as I think the current one could do with some tidying up and adding some
taxonomy.

Here is an outline of my proposal:

Divide the current page in to multiple pages based on categories

-----------------------------------------------List of Categories (not
finalized)

SupportedKamikaze SupportedWhiteRussian WorkInProgress NotSupported
NeverSupported

OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Asus/WL500W

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If anyone else would like to lend a hand that would be great
